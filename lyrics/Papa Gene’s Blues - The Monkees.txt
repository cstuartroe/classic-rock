[Verse 1]
No heartaches felt, no longer lonely
Nights of waiting, finally won me
Happiness that's all rolled up in you

[Verse 2]
And now with you as inspiration
I look toward a destination
Sunny bright that once before was blue

[Chorus]
I have no more than I did before
But now I've got all that I need
For I love you and I know you love me

[Verse 3]
So take my hand I'll start my journey
Free from all the helpless worry
That besets a man when he's alone

[Verse 4]
For strength is mine when we're together
And with you I know I'll never
Have to pass the high road for the low

[Chorus]
I have no more than I did before
But now I've got all that I need
For I love you and I know you love me

Spoken during guitar solo:
"Play magic fingers... aw pick it Luther"

[Chorus]
I have no more than I did before
But now I've got all that I need
For I love you and I know you love me
Yes, I love you and I know you love me
