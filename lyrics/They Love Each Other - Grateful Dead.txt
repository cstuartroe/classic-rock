[Verse 1]
Merry run around, sailin' up and down
Looking for a shove in some direction
Got it from the top, it's nothing you can stop
Lord, you know they made a fine connection

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 2]
He could pass his time, around some other line
But you know he chose this place beside her
Don't get in their way, there's nothing you can say
Nothing that you need to add or do

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's nothing, they explain, it's like a diesel train
You better not be there when it rolls over
And when that train rolls in, you wonder where it's been
You gotta try and see a little further

[Bridge]
Though you'll make a noise, just can't hear your voice
All the dizzy ride on your cold shoulder

Won't you believe what I say is true?
Everything I did I heard it first from you

[Verse 4]
Everything I tell you, I heard it first from you
Heard your news report, you know you're falling short
Pretty soon, we'll trust you for the weather
When that ship comes in, you won't know where it's been
You got to try to see a little further

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
