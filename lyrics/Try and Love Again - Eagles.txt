When you're out there on your own
Where your memories can find you
Like a circle goes around
You were lost until you found out
What it all comes down to

One by one
The lonely feelings come
Day by day, they slowly fade away

Ooh, the look was in her eyes
You never know what might be found there
She was dancing right in time
And the moves she made so fine
Like the music that surrounds her

Should I stay or go?
I really want to know
Would I lose or win
If I try and love again?
Ooohh gonna try and love again
Ooohh I'm gonna try and love again
Ooohh gonna try and love

Right or wrong, what's done is done
It's only moments that we borrow
But the thoughts will linger on
Of the lady and her song
When the sun comes up tomorrow
Well, it might take years to see
Through all these tears
Don't let go
When you find it you will know

Oh, gonna try and love again
Oh, gonna try and love again
Oh, gonna try and love again
Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
Sometimes lose, sometimes win
Sometimes you need a friend
Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
Gonna try
Gonna try
Gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try
