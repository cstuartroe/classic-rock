Hello, baby!
Yeah, ow!
Ow..

[Verse 1]
U.S. prime, grade A stamped guaranteed
Just grease it up and bring on the heat
You gotta it down and roll it over once, maybe twice
Then chow down down down down

[Chorus]
She's good enough, good enough to huh!
I can't get enough, I can't get enough
She's good enough to huh!
Hey me yea I been working up an appetite
Seems like the harder I work the more my body needs
I like to open up give me six on the half shell
Then it's 3-6-9 times

[Chorus]
She's good enough, good enough to huh!
I can't get enough, I can't get enough
She's good enough to huh!
Hey me yea I been working up an appetite
Seems like the harder I work the more my body needs
I like to open up give me six on the half shell
Then it's 3-6-9 times

[Verse 2]
Hey waitress you got any specials here tonight
Me and the fellas might be interested in
Rack a what
Well I'll have some of that
I'll be the first to say that I'm blind to the world
Cause I'm two days gone and I just can't see
But I ain't no fool and honey I know a good thing
And she's comin' she's comin'
So come on, come on, come on cause she's
Good, good, good enough
Good, good, good enough
Good, good, good enough
Good, good, good enough
