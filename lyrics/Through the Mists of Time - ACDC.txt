[Verse 1]
See dark shadows on the walls
See the pictures
Some hang, some fall
And the painted faces all in a line

[Pre-Chorus]
And the painted ladies
Yeah, the painted ladies

[Chorus]
Through the mists of time
The mists of time
Of the restless kind
Through the mists of time
On a magic ride
Through the mists of time

[Verse 2]
Hear the whisper
Of the whirlwind
Monster shadows
A light gone dim
Dark horses
Roam in my sleep
Mystic voices
Conjure up our dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
And the painted ladies
Yeah, the painted ladies

[Chorus]
Through the mists of time
The mists of time
Of the restless kind
Through the mists of time
On a magic ride
Through the mists of time

[Solo]

[Bridge]
And the painted faces
Looking so divine

[Chorus]
Through the mists of time
The mists of time
Of the restless kind
Through the mists of time
On a magic ride
Searchin' for a sign
Through the mists of time
The mists of time, time
