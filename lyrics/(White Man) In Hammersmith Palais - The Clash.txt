[Intro]
1,2, a'1, 2,3,4

[Verse 1]
Ooh
Midnight to six, man
For the first time from Jamaica
Dillinger and a'Leroy Smart
Delroy Wilson, your cool operator

[Verse 2]
Ken Boothe for UK pop reggae
With backin' bands sound systems
If they got anything to say
There's many black ears here to listen

[Verse 3]
But it was Four Tops all night with encores from stage right
Charging from the bass knives to the treble
But onstage they ain't got no roots rock rebel
Onstage they ain't got no...roots rock rebel

[Bridge]
(Dress back, jump back, this is a bluebeat attack)

[Verse 4]
'Cause it won't get you anywhere
Foolin' with the guns
The British Army is waitin' out there
An' it weighs fifteen hundred tons

[Verse 5]
White youth, black youth
Better find another solution
Why not phone up a'Robin Hood
And ask him for some wealth distribution?

[Verse 6]
Punk rocker in the UK
They won't notice anyway
They're all too busy fightin'
For a good place under the lightin'

[Verse 7]
The new groups are not concerned
With what there is to be learned
They got Burton suits, huh, ya' think it's funny
Turnin' rebellion into money

[Verse 8]
All over people changin' their votes
Along with their overcoats
If Adolf Hitler flew in today
They'd send a limousine anyway

[Verse 9]
I'm the all-night drug-prowling' wolf
Who looks so sick in the sun
I'm the white man in the Palais
Just a'lookin' for fun
Only lookin' for fun

[Bridge]
Oh, please mister
Just leave me alone

[Outro]
I'm only
Lookin' for fun
