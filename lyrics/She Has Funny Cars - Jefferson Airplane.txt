Every day I try so hard to know your mind
And find out what's inside you
Time goes on and I don't know just where you are
Or how I'm going to find you

You can do whatever you please
The world's waiting to be seized
You can collect all the neglect
Or all the self-respect you need, what you need

And I know... and I know... and I know

Your mind's guaranteed
It's all you'll ever need
So what do you want with me?

We live but once but good things can be found around
In spite of all the sorrow
If you see black you can't look back
You can't look front you cannot face tomorrow

Some have it nice
Fat and round, flash, paradise
They're very wise to their disguise
Trying to revolutionize tomorrow

And I know... and I know... and I know

Your mind's guaranteed
It's all you'll ever need
So what do you want with me?
