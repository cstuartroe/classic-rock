[Verse 1]
Hey, Tonight
Going to be tonight
Don't you know I'm flying
Tonight, tonight
Hey, come on
Going to chase tomorrow
Tonight, tonight

[Chorus]
Going to get it to the rafters
Watch me now
Jody's going to get religion
All night long

[Verse 2]
Hey, come on
Going to hear the sun
Tonight, tonight

[Chorus]
Going to get it to the rafters
Watch me now
Jody's going to get religion
All night long

[Outro]
Aaaah!
Hey, Tonight
Gonna be tonight
Don't you know I'm flying
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
