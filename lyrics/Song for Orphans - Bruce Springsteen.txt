[Verse 1]
Well the multitude assembled and tried to make the noise
Them black blind poet generals and restless loud white boys
But time's grew thin and the axis grew somehow incomplete
Where instead of child lions we had aging junkie sheep

[Verse 2]
Well how many wasted have I seen signed "Hollywood or bust"
And left to ride the ever ghostly Arizona gusts
Cheerleader tramps and kids with big amps sounding in the void
High society vamps, ex-heavyweight champs mistaking soot for soil

[Chorus]
So break me now big Mama as Old Faithful breaks the day
Believe me my good Linda, the aurora will shine the way
The confederacy's in my name now, the hounds are held at bay
The axis needs a stronger arm, do you feel your muscles play

[Verse 3]
Well the doorstep blanket weaver, Madonna pushes bells
From house to house I see her giving last kisses and wishing well
To every gypsy mystic hero that the kids might find a place
Who get lost forever to mom and pop on their weekends out in space

[Verse 4]
Well sons they search for fathers, but the fathers are all gone
The lost souls search for saviors, but saviors don't last long
Those aimless questless renegade brats who live their lives in song
They run the length of a candle, with a goodnight whisper and they're gone

[Chorus]
So break me now big Mama as Old Faithful breaks the day
Believe me my good Linda, the aurora will shine the way
The confederacy's in my name now, the hounds are held at bay
The axis needs a stronger arm, do you feel your muscles play

Yeah!

[Verse 5]
Well the missions are filled with hermits, they're looking for a friend
The terraces are filled with cat-men just looking for a way in
Those orphans jumped on silver mountains lost in celestial alleyways
They wait for that old tramp Dog Man Moses, he takes in all the strays

[Verse 6]
Now don't you grow on empty legends or lonely cradle songs
Billy the Kid was just a bowery boy who made a living twirling his guns
The night she's long and lanky and she speaks in a mother tongue
She lullabies the refugees with amplifier's hum

[Chorus]
So break me now big Mama as Old Faithful breaks the day
Believe me my good Linda, the aurora will shine the way
The confederacy's in my name now, the hounds are held at bay
The axis needs a stronger arm, do you feel your muscles play
The confederacy's in my name now, the hounds are held at bay
The axis needs a stronger arm, do you feel your muscles play
