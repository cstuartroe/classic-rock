[Intro]
(Rain, rain, go away, come again another day)

[Verse 1]
Early in the morning
The sun was up and the sky was very blue
Without a warning
As I looked out, my thoughts returned to you
A noise in the city made the children run
And hide themselves away
And thunder boomed and lightning filled the sky

[Verse 2]
Looking from this window
A thousand rivers running past my door
Standing on an island
Looking for someone upon the shore
I can see it very clearly, nothing's really changed
Then lightning strikes across an empty sky

[Chorus]
Ooh, the rain is falling
Ooh, the rain is falling
Ooh, the rain is falling
Will it wash away those lonely tears?

(It's raining, it's pouring, the old man is snoring)

[Verse 3]
With their brand new time transporter
They'll think maybe I fought to get away
But with all their great inventions
And all their good intentions, here I stay
Down on the corner where the sun had shone
The people gathered 'round
Then scattered as the raindrops hit the ground

[Outro]
Ooh, the rain is falling
Ooh, the rain is falling
Said ooh, the rain is falling
Will it wash away those lonely tears?

(It's raining, it's pouring, the old man is snoring)

Ooh, the rain is falling
I said ooh, the rain is falling
Ooh, rain keeps on falling, falling
Will it wash away those lonely tears?

(It's raining, it's pouring, the old man is snoring)
(Rain rain, go away, come again another day)
