[Verse 1]
Living room, passing time
Talkin' trash, sipping wine
I need something more substantial
New deck of playing cards
I don't like to work this hard
I think I'll have to cancel

[Chorus]
I'm running out of time
I'm about to lose my mind
I got the six
Gimme your nine

[Verse 2]
Slow hand on the clock
I'm sitting here like a rock
I'm feeling so abnormal
Pictures in the magazines
All my thoughts are so obscene
Cover up that centerfold

[Chorus]
I'm running out of time
I'm about to lose my mind
I got the six
Gimme your nine

[Verse 3]
Look at this, what a pair
She won't let me touch her there
She's so discriminating
This is weird, it's time to blow
I just heard the rooster crow
I guess I'll have to spank my monkey

[Chorus]
I'm running out of time
I'm about to lose my mind
I got the six
Gimme your nine

[Instrumental outro 1:43-2:54]
