[Verse 1]
Howdy, friend, begging your pardon
Is there something on your mind?
You've gone and sold all your belongings
Is that something in your eye?
Well, I know you really never
Liked the way it all goes down
Go on, Hideaway
What's that you say?
We're all bound for the graveyard
Oooh, I wish you well
Think it's going to rain
Oh, what's the difference
Is there some way I can help?

[Chorus]
Because you know, I'm going to miss you
When you're gone, oh, Lord
Wish I Could Hideaway

[Verse 2]
Hold on, give yourself a chance
I can hear the leaving train
All aboard! Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye!
Oooh, I wish you well
See you soon, maybe tomorrow
You can never tell

[Chorus]
Because you know, I'm going to miss you
When you're gone, oh
Wish I could Hideaway

[Outro]
Hideaway [x8]
