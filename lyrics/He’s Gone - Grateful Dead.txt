[Chorus 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus 2]
Now, he's gone, now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone, like a steam locomotive
Rolling down the track, he's gone, he's gone
And nothin's going to  bring him back, he's gone

[Verse 1]
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
Lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Chorus 2]
Same old, rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus 2]
Ne

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive
Rolling down the track, he's gone, he's gone
And nothing's going to bring him back, he's gone
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back[2x]
