[Intro]
Oh
Hello

[Verse 1]
Think I'll let her keep on goin'
Where ever it is, she's goin' to
Give her my autograph and tell her
"It's been nice knowin' you"

[Chorus]
Ha, she's a star collector (Collector of stars)
She only aims to please young celebrities
Yes, she's a star collector (Collector of stars)
How can I love her
When I just don't respect her?

[Verse 2]
When everthing is goin' my way
She wants to be close at hand
She moves to some other doorway
When things don't go the way she planned

[Chorus]
Yes, she's a star collector (Collector of stars)
She only aims to please young celebrities
Yes, she's a star collector (Collector of stars)
Whoa, It won't take much time
Before I get her off my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause, she's a star collector (Collector of stars)
Whoa, she only aims to please young celebrities
Yes, she's a star collector (Collector of stars)
Whoa, It won't take much time
Before I get her off my mind

[Outro]
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Good-bye, goodbye
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye
