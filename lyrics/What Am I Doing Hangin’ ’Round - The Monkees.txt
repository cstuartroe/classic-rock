[Verse 1]
Just a loudmouth Yankee, I went down to Mexico
I didn't have much time to spend, about a week or so
There I lightly took advantage of a girl who loved me so
But I found myself a-thinkin' when the time had come to go

[Chorus]
What am I doin' hangin' 'round?
I should be on that train and gone
I should be ridin' on that train to San Antone
What am I doin' hangin' 'round?

[Verse 2]
She took me to the garden just for a little walk
I didn't know much Spanish, and there was no time for talk
Then she told me that she loved me, not with words but with a kiss
And like a fool I kept on thinkin' of a train I could not miss

[Chorus]
What am I doin' hangin' 'round?
I should be on that train and gone
I should be ridin' on that train to San Antone
What am I doin' hangin' 'round?

[Verse 3]
Well, it's been a year or so, and I wanna go back again
And if I get the money, well I'll ride the same old train
But I guess your chances come but once and boy, I sure missed mine
And still I can't stop thinkin' when I hear some whistle cryin'

[Chorus]
What am I doin' hangin' 'round?
I should be on that train and gone
I should be ridin' on that train to San Antone
What am I doin' hangin' 'round?

[Chorus]
What am I doin' hangin' 'round?
I should be on that train and gone
I should be ridin' on that train to San Antone
What am I doin' hangin' 'round?

[Chorus]
What am I doin' hangin' 'round?
I should be on that train and gone
I should be ridin' on that train to San Antone
What am I doin' hangin' 'round?
