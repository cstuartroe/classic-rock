[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I got a girl she lives cross town
She's the one that really gets down
When she boogie
She do the tube snake boogie

[Chorus]
Well now boogie little baby
Boogie woogie all night long

[Verse 2]
I got a girl she lives on the block
She kinda funky with her pink and black socks
She likes to boogie
She do the tube snake boogie

[Chorus]
Well now boogie little baby
Boogie woogie all night long

[Verse 3]
I got a girl, she lives on the hill
She won't do it but her sister will
When she boogie
She do the tube snake boogie

[Outro]
Well now boogie little baby
Boogie woogie all night long
Blow your top blow your top blow your top
