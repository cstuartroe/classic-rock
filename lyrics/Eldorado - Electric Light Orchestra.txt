Here it comes, another lonely day
Playing the game, I'll sail away
On a voyage of no return to see
If eternal life is meant to be
And if I find the key
To the eternal dream

The painted ladies of the Avalon
Play in the sun, take to the road
To the north, there lies the chills of cold
To the south, there lies the tales untold
Oh, but in between, there lies
The place to close your eyes

And I will stay
I'll not be back, Eldorado
I will be free
Of the world, Eldorado

"Say goodbye," the city's heroes sing
Bird on the wing, feel, feel so free
Oh, the life upon the rooftop haze
All the cheating and the broken days
So through it all, I see
There's nothing left for me

So I will stay
I'll not be back, Eldorado
I will be free
Of the world, Eldorado

Sitting here on top of everywhere
What do I care? Days never end
Though the voyage's end will soon be here
No eternal life is here for me
Oh, and now I found the key
To the eternal dream

Then I will stay
I'll not be back, Eldorado
I will be free
Of the world, Eldorado
Then I will stay
I'll not be back, Eldorado
