[Chorus]
Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Chooglin', chooglin'

[Verse 1]
Maybe you don't understand it
But if you're a natural man
You got to ball and have a good time
And that's what I call choogling
Here comes Mary looking for Harry
She going to choogle tonight
Here comes Louie, works in the sewer
He going to choogle tonight

[Chorus]
Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Chooglin', chooglin', chooglin', chooglin'

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Harmonica Solo]

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Chorus]
Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Chooglin', chooglin'

[Verse 2]
If you can choose it, who can refuse it
Y'all be chooglin' tonight
Go on, take your pick, huh, right from the git go
You got to choogle tonight

[Chorus]
Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Hooglin', chooglin', chooglin', chooglin', chooglin', chooglin'
Ahhhh-na-na-na-na

[Guitar Solo 3]

[Outro]
Ahhhh-na-na-na-na
Oh, we're Creedence!
Clearwater!
Revival!
