[Verse 1]
I was standing in the jungle, I was feeling alright
I was wandering in the darkness in the middle of the night
The moon began to shine, I saw a clearing ahead
But what's that going on, I think I'm out of my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Chooka chooka hoo la ley
Looka looka koo la ley

[Verse 2]
A hundred animals were gathered around this night
And they were singing out a lovely song
Under the pale moonlight
I stood and stared for quite a while
Then a lion sang to me and smiled:
"Come and join us if you so desire."
They sang...

[Chorus]
Chooka chooka hoo la ley
(That's what they sang)
Looka looka koo la ley
(And it started to rain)
Chooka chooka hoo la ley
(That's what they sang)
Looka looka koo la ley

[Verse 3]
I said now "please explain the meaning of this song you sing"
"Wondrous is our great blue ship
That sails around the mighty sun
And joy to everyone that rides along!"
They sang...

[Pre-Chorus]
Chooka chooka hoo la ley
(That's what they sang)
Looka looka koo la ley

Ah that's nice!
And they danced!

[Verse 4]
Pretty soon I knew the tune
And we sat and sang under the moon
And the jungle rang in joyful harmony
They sang...

[Chorus]
Chooka chooka hoo la ley
(That's what they sang)
Looka looka koo la ley
(And it started to rain)
Chooka chooka hoo la ley
(That's what they sang)
Looka looka koo la ley

"Wondrous is our great blue ship
That sails around the mighty sun
And joy to everyone that rides along!‚Äù
