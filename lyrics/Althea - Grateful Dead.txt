[Chorus]
I told Althea I was feeling lost
Lacking in some direction
Althea told me upon scrutiny
My back might need protection
I told Althea that treachery
Was tearing me limb from limb
Althea told me: now cool down boy
Settle back easy Jim

[Verse]
You may be Saturday's child all grown
Moving with a pinch of grace
You may be a clown in the burying ground
Or just another pretty face
You may be the fate of Ophelia
Sleeping and perchance to dream
Honest to the point of recklessness
Self centered to the extreme
Ain't nobody messing with you but you
Your friends are getting most concerned
Loose with the truth
Maybe it's your fire
But baby...don't get burned
When the smoke has cleared, she said
That's what she said to me
You're going to  want a bed to lay your head
And a little sympathy
There are things you can replace
And others you cannot
The time has come to weigh those things
This space is getting hot
You know this space is getting hot

[Chorus]
I told Althea
I'm a roving sign
That I was born to be a bachelor
Althea told me: Ok that's fine
So now I'm out trying to catch her

[Outro]
Can't talk to you without talking to me
We're guilty of the same old thing
Talking a lot about less and less
And forgetting the love we bring
