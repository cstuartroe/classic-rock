[Intro]
A penny in your pocket
Suitcase in your hand
They won't get you very far
Now you're a 21st century man

[Verse: I]
Fly across the city
Rise above the land
You can do 'most anything
Now you're a 21st century man

[Chorus]
Though you ride on the wheels of tomorrow (Tomorrow)
You still wander the fields of your sorrow
What will it bring?

[Verse: II]
One day you're a hero
Next day you're a clown
There's nothing that is in-between
Now you're a 21st century man

You should be so happy
You should be so glad
So why are you so lonely
You 21st century man?

[Verse: III]
You stepped out of a dream
Believing everything was gone
Return with what you've learned
They'll kiss the ground you walk upon

(21st century man)

Things ain't how you thought they were
Nothing have you planned
So pick up your penny and your suitcase
You're not a 21st century man

[Chorus]
Though you ride on the wheels of tomorrow (Tomorrow)
You still wander the fields of your sorrow (Sorrow)
Tomorrow, 21st century man

[Coda]
21st century man
21st century man...
