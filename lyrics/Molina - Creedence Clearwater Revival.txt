[Chorus]
Molina, where you going to? [x2]

[Verse 1]
She's daughter to the mayor
Messing with the sheriff
Driving in a blue car
She don't see no red light

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
She's coming in the morning
Looking a disaster
Driving in the prowl car
Spent the night in jail

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sheriff going to go far
Driving to the state house
If she makes a million
Papa can retire

[Chorus x2]
