[Intro]
"Moon in both [houses]..." 
"...Scorpio, [Arabian Skies], Libra..." 
"...Pluto was not discovered until 1930..."

[Verse 1]
Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan, stars can frighten

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Blinding signs flap
Flicker, flicker, flicker, blam
Pow, pow
Stairway scare Dan Dare who’s there?

[Verse 3]
Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds
The icy waters underground
