[Verse 1]
Riding top the floodway on a Friday night
The landscape's a fine and natural sight
Just cruising slow through the dark of night
With Precious and Grace everything's all right

[Verse 2]
Good God Almighty
We was going down slow
Yeah, if we knew just where we had to go
Crying, just a flying down a put out road
With Precious and Grace in my flathead Ford

[Instrumental break 1:02-1:45]

[Verse 3]
So if you're out rolling late some night
Yeah, and you need that supernatural delight
I'm talking to you, brother
I know somebody's, they's just out of sight
Get with Precious and Grace
They gonna to treat you right

[Instrumental outro 2:11-3:09]
