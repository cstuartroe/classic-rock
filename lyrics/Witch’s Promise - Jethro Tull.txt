Lend me your ear while I call you a fool
You were kissed by a witch one night in the wood
And later insisted your feelings were true
The witches promise was coming
Believing he listened while laughing you flew

Leaves falling, red, yellow, brown, all look the same
And the love you had found lay outside in the rain
Washed clean by the water but nursing its pain
The witches promise was coming
And you're looking elsewhere for your own selfish gain

Keep looking, keep looking for somewhere to be
Well, you're wasting your time, they're not stupid like he is
Meanwhile leaves are still falling, you're too blind to see
You won't find it easy now, it's only fair
He was willing to give to you, you didn't care
You're waiting for more but you've already had your share
The witches promise is turning
So don't you wait up for him, he's going to be late
