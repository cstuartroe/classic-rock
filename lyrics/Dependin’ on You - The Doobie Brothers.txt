When I was so low
You were there to lift me up
Well, there's one thing I know for sure, babe
You're gonna win life's lovin' cup

Darlin', you're always there at my rescue
Dependin' on you
Darlin', you're always there by my side
You're always there by my side
Darlin', you're always there at my rescue
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Now when I get too high
You are there to cool me down
So fine, I just keep dependin' on you
Someone to turn to, keepin' my feet on the ground

Dependin' on you
Darlin', you're always there at my rescue
I'm dependin' on you, babe
Darlin' you're always there by my side
You're always there by my side
Darlin', you're always there at my rescue
