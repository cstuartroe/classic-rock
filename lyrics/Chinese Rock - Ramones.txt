[Verse 1]
Somebody called me on the phone
Say, Hey hey, is Arty home?
You want to take a walk, you want to go cop?
You want to go get some Chinese rock?

[Chorus]
I'm living on a Chinese rock
All my best things are in hock
I'm living on a Chinese rock
Everything is in the pawn shop

[Verse 2]
The plaster's falling off the wall
My girlfriend's crying in the shower stall
It's hot as the bitch, I should've been rich
But I'm just digging a Chinese ditch

[Chorus]
I'm living on a Chinese rock
All my best things are in hock
I'm living on a Chinese rock
Everything is in the pawn shop
Ooh aah, ooh aah

[Verse 3]
The plaster's falling off the wall
My girlfriend's crying in the shower stall
It's hot as the bitch, I should've been rich
But I'm just digging a Chinese ditch

[Chorus]
I'm living on a Chinese rock
All my best things are in hock
I'm living on a Chinese rock
Everything is in the pawn shop

[Outro]
I'm living on a Chinese rock
I'm living on a Chinese rock
I'm living on a Chinese rock
I'm living on a Chinese rock
