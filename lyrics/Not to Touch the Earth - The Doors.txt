[Intro]
Not to touch the earth
Not to see the sun
Nothing left to do, but
Run, run, run
Let's run
Let's run

[Verse 1]
House upon the hill
Moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees
Witnessing the wild breeze
Come on, baby, run with me
Let's run

[Chorus]
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run

[Verse 2]
The mansion is warm, at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you won't know a thing till you get inside

[Verse 3]
Dead president's corpse in the driver's car
The engine runs on glue and tar
Come on along, not going very far
To the East to meet the Czar

[Chorus]
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa!

[Verse 4]
Some outlaws lived by the side of a lake
The minister's daughter's in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road
Wake up, girl, we're almost home
Ya, come on!

[Bridge]
We should see the gates by morning
We should be inside the evening
Sun, sun, sun
Burn, burn, burn
Soon, soon, soon
Moon, moon, moon
I will get you
Soon!
Soon!
Soon!

[Outro]
I am the Lizard King
I can do anything
