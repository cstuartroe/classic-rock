[Verse 1]
Have I ever told you
How good it feels to hold you
It isn't easy to explain

[Bridge]
And though I'm really trying
I think I may start crying
My heart can't wait another day

[Pre-Chorus]
When you kiss me I just got to
Kiss me I just got to
Kiss me I just got to say

[Chorus]
Baby, I love you
Come on baby
Baby, I love you
Baby I love, I love only you

[Verse 2]
I can't live without you
I love everything about you
I can't help it if I feel this way

[Bridge]
Oh I'm so glad I found you
I want my arms around you
I love to hear you call my name

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh tell me that you feel
Tell me that you feel
Tell me that you feel the same

[Chorus]
Baby, I love you
Come on baby
Baby, I love you
Baby I love, I love only you

[Bridge]
Oh I'm so glad I found you
I want my arms around you
I love to hear you call my name

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh tell me that you feel
Tell me that you feel
Tell me that you feel the same

[Chorus]
Baby, I love you
Baby, I love you
Baby, I love you
Baby, I love you
Baby, I love you
Come on baby
Baby, I love you
Baby, I love you
Come on baby
Baby, I love you
Baby, I love you
Come on baby
Baby, I love you
Come on baby
Baby, I love you
Baby, I love you
