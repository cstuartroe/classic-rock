You're only pretty as you feel
Only pretty as you feel inside
You're only pretty as you feel
Just as pretty as you feel inside

When you wake up in the morning
Rub some sleep from your eye
Look inside your mirror
Comb your hair

Don't give vanity a second thought
No No No
Beauty's only skin deep
It goes just so far 'cause

You're only pretty as you feel
As pretty as you feel inside
You're only pretty as you feel

So girl, don't hang yourself up
On no plastic face
A little bit of soap will wipe away
Any grease

Cause you're only pretty as you feel
Mama, I say
You're only pretty as you feel inside
Straight ah

So now you're feelin' pretty
Now you're feelin good
Now you're ready to face the world
Now you're feelin good

Go out there and knock them silly girl
Go out there, show 'em how to thrill
Go out there, show 'em how to thrill

Cause you're only pretty as you feel
Say, you're only pretty as you feel
Mama, you're only pretty as you feel
Pretty as you feel inside

Now, you're only pretty as you feel
Feelin' pretty, Feelin' pretty
You're only pretty as you feel
Feelin' so pretty, Feelin' so pretty

You're feeling so pretty
You're feeling so pretty
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty mama, mama
