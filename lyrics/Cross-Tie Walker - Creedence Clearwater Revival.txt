[Verse]
I went down to the station, just to take a ride [2x]
Found myself on a flatcar, yesterday behind
Pulling out from the platform, there was no brass band
I pulled out from the platform, nobody raised a hand
And there were no tears of regret from my runaway train
Train [4x]
Got no sand in my pocket, you know I ain't tied down
Ain't no sand in my pocket, never do sit down
I'm just a cross-tie walker, where the freight trains run
Run [4x]
If you see me a'coming don't you waste my time [2x]
Cause there's more miles between us than the Santa Fe Line
Run [4x]

[Outro]
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm....
