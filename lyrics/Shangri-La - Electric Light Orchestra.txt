[Intro]
I'm getting out, I'm getting out

[Verse 1]
Sitting here, waiting for
Someone calling at my door
Too bad
I'm getting out of love

[Verse 2]
What's the use of changing things?
Wonder what tomorrow brings
Who knows?
I'm getting out of love

[Chorus]
My Shangri-La has gone away
Fading like The Beatles on "Hey Jude"
She seemed to drift out on the rain
That came in somewhere softly from the blue

[Interlude]
Duh-dah-deh-de-doo-deh-doo
I'm getting out, I'm getting out

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Clouds roll by and hide the sun
Raindrops falling on everyone
So sad
I'm getting out of love
Yeah-yeah-yeah

[Chorus]
My Shangri-La has gone away
Fading like The Beatles on "Hey Jude"
She seemed to drift out on the rain
That came in somewhere softly from the blue (the blue, the blue)
Doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
My Shangri-La has gone away
Fading like The Beatles on "Hey Jude" (Do me, baby!)
She seemed to drift out on the rain
That came in somewhere softly from the blue

[Bridge]
I'm getting out of love
Where is my Shangri-La?
Doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-dah-dey
Where is my Shangri-La?
I'm getting out of love

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
I will return
(I will return)
I will return to Shangri-La
(I will return)
I will return to Shangri-La
(I will return)
I will return to Shangri-La
