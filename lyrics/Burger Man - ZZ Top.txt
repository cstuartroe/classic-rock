[Verse 1]
My charcoal's getting red hot
Put your order in my hand
Won't you let me show you what I got
Sizzling in the pan

[Chorus]
Any way you want it baby
I am your burger man

[Verse 2]
If you need good hot grilling
Try my burger stand
If you need a slice of thrilling
I'm the baddest in the land

[Chorus]

[Spoken]
Did you want double meat?
How 'bout some fries on the side?

[Verse 3]
Once you try my burger baby
You'll grow a new thyroid gland
I said just eat my burger, baby
Make you smart as Charlie Chan

[Outro]
You see the hot sauce can't be beat
Sit back and open wide
