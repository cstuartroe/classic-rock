[Verse 1]
Won't you try
Won't you try
Won't you try
Find a way to need someone
Find a way to see
Find a way to need someone and the sunshine will set you free
Won't you try
With love before we're gone
Won't you try
Won't you try
Won't you try

[Verse 2]
Saturday afternoon
Saturday afternoon
When your head is feeling fine
You can ride inside our car
I will give you caps of blue and silver sunlight for your hair
All that soon will be is what you need to see, my love
Won't you try
Won't you try
I do care that you do see
Is it time to leave, my lady
Yes it is I know
Round about and everywhere sunshine instead of snow
Times can't change that what I say is true

[Verse 3]
I'll come through for you
And I'll come through for you, my love
Won't you try
Won't you try
Won't you try
Won't you try
Saturday afternoon
Yellow clouds rising in the noon
Acid incense and balloons
Saturday afternoon
People dancing everywhere
Loudly shouting I don't care
It's a time for growing, and a time for knowing
Saturday afternoon
Saturday afternoon (won't you try)
Saturday afternoon (won't you try)
Saturday afternoon (won't you try)
Won't you try (Saturday afternoon)
Won't you try (Saturday afternoon)
Won't you try
Won't you try
