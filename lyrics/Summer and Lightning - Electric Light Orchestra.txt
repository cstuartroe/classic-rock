[Verse 1]
I have waited
For your love
For so long
How do I go on?
I have told you (Sha-la-la)
So many times (Sha-la-la)
It's no good (Sha-la-la)
You're treatin' me so wrong (Sha-la-la)

[Pre-Chorus]
Out there so far away (so far away)
Above the sky will say
For you...

[Chorus 1]
Here it comes again
It's all around me
It must be magic
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I can see you (I see you)
In my mind (in my mind)
The lost time (losin' time)
That you're savin'
I could reach out (I reach out)
And touch you (touchin' you)
What can I do (what can I do)?
The sun ain't shinin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Out there so far away
Above the sky will say
For you
Only for you...

[Chorus 2]
Here it comes again
(Summer and lightning)
It's all around me
(Summer and lightning)
It must be magic
(Summer and lightning)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Interlude]
Hear it comes again

I can feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it
(Echo) You, you, you...

[Chorus 2]
Here it comes again
(Summer and lightning)
It's all around me
(Summer and lightning)
It must be magic
(Summer and lightning)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Oh, here it comes again
(Summer and lightning)
I can feel it
(Summer and lightning)
It's all around me
(Summer and lightning)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Summer and lightning)...
