[Verse]
Hey, look at the hooks
On your pants makes you want to dance

[Chorus]
I say yeah yeah
I say yeah yeah
There ain't never a catch, all you got to do is snatch
Do the velcro fly
Do the velcro fly

[Verse 2]
You need just enough of that sticky stuff
To hold the seams of your fine blue jeans

[Chorus]
I say yeah yeah
I say yeah yeah
There ain't never a catch, all you got to do is snatch
Do the velcro fly
Do the velcro fly

[Verse 3]
Well, it feels so right when you squeezed it tight
When you reach the end do it over again

[Chorus]
I say yeah yeah
I say yeah yeah
There ain't never a catch, all you got to do is snatch
Do the velcro fly
Do the velcro fly
