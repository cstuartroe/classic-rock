[Verse 1]
You've got to pick up the pieces, come on, sort your trash
Better pull yourself back together, maybe you've got too much cash
Better call, call the law, when are you gonna turn yourself in? Yeah
You're a politician, don't become one of Hitler's children

[Pre-Chorus]
Bonzo goes to Bitburg then goes out for a cup of tea
As I watched it on TV somehow it really bothered me
Drank in all the bars in town
For an extended foreign policy
Pick up the pieces

[Chorus]
My brain is hanging upside down
I need something to slow me down (Ooo-yeah)
My brain is hanging upside down
And I need something to slow me down

[Verse 2]
Shouldn't wish you happiness
Wish her the very best
Fifty thousand dollar dress
Shaking after your highness
See through you like cellophane
You watch the world complain
But you do it anyway
Who am I if I'm to say

[Pre-Chorus]
Bonzo goes to Bitburg then goes out for a cup of tea
As I watched it on TV somehow it really bothered me
Drank in all the bars in town
For an extended foreign policy
Pick up the pieces

[Chorus]
My brain is hanging upside down
I need something to slow me down (Ooo-yeah)
My brain is hanging upside down
And I need something to slow me down

[Bridge]
If there's one thing that makes me sick
It's when someone tries to hide behind politics
I wish that time could go by fast
Somehow they manage to make it last

[Chorus]
Ooo-yeah
My brain is hanging upside down
And I need something to slow me down (Ooo-yeah)
My brain is hanging upside down
And I need something to slow me down (Ooo-yeah)
My brain is hanging upside down
And I need something to slow me down
My brain is hanging upside down
