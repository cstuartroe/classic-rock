[Verse 1]
Last night
I saw a fire burning on
The palace lawn
O'er the land
The humble subjects watched in mixed
Emotion

[Chorus]
Who is burning? [x2]
Effigy
Who is burning? [x2]
Effigy

[Verse 2]
Last night
I saw the fire spreading to
The palace door
Silent majority
Weren't keeping quiet
Anymore

[Chorus]
Who is burning? [x2]
Effigy
Who is burning? [x2]
Effigy

[Verse 3]
Last night
I saw the fire spreading to
The country side
In the morning
Few were left to watch
The ashes die

[Chorus]
Who is burning? [x2]
Effigy
Who is burning? [x2]
Effigy

[Outro]
Why? [x3]
Effigy
