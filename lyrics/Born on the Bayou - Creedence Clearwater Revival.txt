[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Now, when I was just a little boy
Standin' to my Daddy's knee
My papa said, "Son, don't let the man get you
An' do what he done to me."
Because he'll get you
Because  he'll get you now, now

[Verse 2]
An' I can remember the fourth o' July
Runnin' through the backwood bare
An' I can still hear my ol' hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there

[Hook]
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Wish I was back on the Bayou
Rollin' with some Cajun Queen
Wishin' I were a fast freight train
Just a chooglin' on down to New Orleans

[Hook]
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou, du, du, du ,du

[Bridge]
Do it, do it, do it, do it. Oh, Lord

Oh, get back boy

[Verse 2]
An' I can remember the fourth o' July
Runnin' through the backwood bare
An' I can still hear my ol' hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there

[Hook]
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou

[Outro]
All right! Do, do, do, do

Mmmmmmm, ohh
