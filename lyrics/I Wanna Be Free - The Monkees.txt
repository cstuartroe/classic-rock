I wanna be free
Like the bluebirds flying by me
Like the waves out on the blue sea
If your love has to tie me, don't try me
Say good-bye

I wanna be free
Don't say you love me say you like me
But when I need you beside me
Stay close enough to guide me, confide in
Me
Oh-oh-oh

I wanna hold your hand
Walk along the sand
Laughing in the sun
Always having fun
Doing all those things
Without any strings
To tie me down

I wanna be free
Like the warm September wind, babe
Say you'll always be my friend, babe
We can make it to the end, babe
Again, babe, I gotta say:
I wanna be free
I wanna be free
I wanna be free
