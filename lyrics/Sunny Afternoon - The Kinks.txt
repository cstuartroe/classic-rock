[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
The tax man's taken all my dough
And left me in my stately home
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

And I can't sail my yacht
He's taken everythin' I've got
All I've got's this sunny afternoon

[Chorus]
Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I've got a big fat momma tryin' to break me

And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

In the summertime, in the summertime
In the summertime

[Verse 2]
My girlfriend's run off with my car
And gone back to her ma and pa
Telling tales of drunkenness and cruelty

Now I'm sitting here
Sipping at my ice cold beer
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

[Chorus]
Help me, help me, help me sail away
Well, give me two good reasons why I ought to stay

'Cause I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

In the summertime, in the summertime
In the summertime

Oh, save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I've got a big fat momma tryin' to break me

And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

In the summertime, in the summertime
In the summertime, in the summertime
In the summertime
