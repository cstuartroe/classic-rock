[Verse 1: David Lee Roth]
Have you seen her?
So fine and pretty
Fooled me with her style and ease
And I feel her from across the room
Yes, it's love in the third degree

[Chorus: David Lee Roth, Eddie Van Halen & Michael Anthony]
Ooh, baby, baby
Won'tcha turn your head my way?
Ooh, baby, baby
Come on, take a chance, you're old enough to
Dance the night away
Oh, come on, baby, dance the night away

[Verse 2: David Lee Roth]
A live wire
Barely a beginner, but just watch that lady go
She's on fire
'Cause dancing gets her higher than anything else she knows

[Chorus: David Lee Roth, Eddie Van Halen & Michael Anthony]
Ooh, baby, baby
Won'tcha turn your head my way?
Ooh, baby, baby
Well, don't skip romance, 'cause you're old enough to
Dance the night away
Oh, come on, baby, dance the night away

[Bridge: David Lee Roth]
Ohh, oh-oh-oh, oh yeah

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro: David Lee Roth, Eddie Van Halen & Michael Anthony]
Dance the night away
Hey, hey, yeah
Dance, dance, dance the night away
Uh-come on, baby
Dance the night away
Hey, hey, yeah
Dance, dance, dance the night away
Uh-come on, baby, baby
Dance the night away
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
Dance, dance, dance the night away
Ahh, ahh-ah, ow!
