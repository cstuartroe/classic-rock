[Verse 1]
Woke up early feeling light (Shame, it's a shame)
Somebody got to me last night (Shame, it's a shame)
Sat down for a friendly duel (Shame, it's a shame)
With one-eyed jacks and jokers, too (Shame, it's a shame)

[Chorus]
Ooh, sailor man (Shame, it's a shame) [x2]

[Verse 2]
Poormouth Henry turned on me (Shame, it's a shame)
Said, "Boy, I'm going to pick you clean." (Shame, it's a shame)

[Chorus]

Oh!

[Verse 3]
Henry said, "Don't you mess that pile" (Shame, it's a shame)
Had three aces and he had five (Shame, it's a shame)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Shame, it's a shame [x5]
