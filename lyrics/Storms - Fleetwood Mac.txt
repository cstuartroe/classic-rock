[Verse 1]
Every night that goes between
I feel a little less
As you slowly go away from me
This is only another test
Every night you do not come
Your softness fades away
Did I ever really care that much?
Is there anything left to say?

[Chorus]
Every hour of fear I spend
My body tries to cry
Living through each empty night
A deadly calm inside

[Verse 2]
I haven't felt this way I feel
Since many a years ago
But in those years are the lifetime's past
I did not deal with the road
And I did not deal with you, I know
Though the love has always been
So I search to find an answer there
So I can truly win

[Chorus]
Every hour of fear I spend
My body tries to cry
Living through each empty night
A deadly calm inside

[Verse 3]
So I try to say goodbye, my friend
I'd like to leave you with something warm
But never have I been a blue calm sea
I have always been a storm
Always been a storm
Ooh, always been a storm
I have always been a storm

[Outro]
We were frail
She said, "Every night he will break your heart"
I should have known from the first
I'd be the brokenhearted
I loved you from the start
Save us
And not all the prayers in the world will save us
