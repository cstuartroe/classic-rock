[Verse 1]
Wond'ring aloud --
How we feel today
Last night sipped the sunset --
My hand in her hair
We are our own saviours
As we start both our hearts beating life
Into each other

[Verse 2]
Wond'ring aloud --
Will the years treat us well
As she floats in the kitchen
I'm tasting the smell, yeah
Of toast as the butter runs
Then she comes, spilling crumbs on the bed
And I shake my head

[Outro]
And it's only the giving
That makes you what you are
