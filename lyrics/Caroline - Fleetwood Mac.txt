[Verse 1]
She's so crazy
She's so lazy
Keeps on coming
Keeps you running

[Chorus]
Caroline
Caroline
Time recedes with a fatal drop
Dusty fury on the mountain top
Cut the cord if you can
Caroline
Caroline

[Verse 2]
She's so cagey
She's so stagey
So attractive
So reactive

[Chorus]
Caroline
Caroline
Time recedes with a fatal drop
Dusty fury on the mountain top
Cut the cord if you can
Caroline
Caroline

[Chorus]
Caroline
Caroline
Time recedes with a fatal drop
Dusty fury on the mountain top
Cut the cord if you can
Caroline
Caroline
Caroline
Caroline
