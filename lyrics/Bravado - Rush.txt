[Verse 1]
If we burn our wings flying too close to the sun
If the moment of glory is over before it's begun

[Chorus 1]
If the dream is won, though everything is lost
We will pay the price, but we will not count the cost
We will pay the price, but we will not count the cost

[Verse 2]
When the dust has cleared and victory denied
A summit too lofty, river a little too wide

[Chorus 2]
If we keep our pride, though paradise is lost
We will pay the price, but we will not count the cost
We will pay the price, but we will not count the cost
Oh

[Verse 3]
And if the music stops, there's only the sound of the rain
All the hope and glory, all the sacrifice in vain

[Chorus 3]
And if the love remains, though everything is lost
We will pay the price, but we will not count the cost
We will pay the price, but we will not count the cost

[Outro]
And if the love remains, though everything is lost
We will pay the price (We will pay the price)
But we will not count the cost (We will not count the cost)
And if the love remains (If the love remains)
Though everything is lost (Though everything is lost)
We will pay the price (We will pay the price)
But we will not count the cost (We will not count the cost)
And if the love remains
