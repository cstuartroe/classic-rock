[Chorus]
Well, I'm against it
I'm against it
Well, I'm against it
I'm against it

[Verse 1]
I don't like politics
I don't like Communists
I don't like games and fun
I don't like anyone

[Chorus]
Well I'm against it
I'm against it
Well, I'm against it
I'm against it

[Verse 2]
I don't like Jesus freaks
I don't like circus geeks
I don't like summer and spring
I don't like anything
I don't like sex and drugs
I don't like water bugs
I don't care about poverty
All I care about is me

[Chorus]
Well I'm against it
I'm against it
Well I'm against it
I'm against it

[Verse 3]
I don't like playing ping pong
I don't like the Viet Cong
I don't like Burger King
I don't like anything

[Chorus]
And I'm against it
I'm against it
Well, I'm against it
I'm against it
Well, I'm against it
I'm against it
