[Intro]

[Verse]
Yeah! Come on, come on, come on, come on
Now touch me, babe
Can't you see that I am not afraid?
What was that promise that you made?
Why won't you tell me what she said?
What was that promise that you made?

[Hook]
Now, I'm going to love you
Till the heavens stop the rain
I'm going to love you
Till the stars fall from the sky
For you and I

[Verse]
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Now touch me, babe
Can't you see that I am not afraid?
What was that promise that you made?
Why won't you tell me what she said?
What was that promise that you made?

[Hook]
Now, I'm going to love you
Till the heavens stop the rain
I'm going to love you
Till the stars fall from the sky
For you and  I

[Hook]
I'm going to love you
'Til the heavens stop the rain
I'm going to love you
'Til the stars fall from the sky
For you and I

[Sax Solo]

[Outro]
Stronger than dirt
