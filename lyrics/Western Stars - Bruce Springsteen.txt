[Verse 1]
I wake up in the morning, just glad my boots are on
Instead of empty in the whispering grasses
Down the Five at Forest Lawn
On the set, the makeup girl brings me two raw eggs and a shot of gin
Then I give it all up for that little blue pill
That promises to bring it all back to you again

[Chorus]
Ride me down easy, ride me down easy, friend
Tonight the western stars are shining bright again

[Verse 2]
Here in the canyons above Sunset, the desert don't give up the fight
A coyote with someone’s Chihuahua in its teeth skitters 'cross my veranda in the night
Some lost sheep from Oklahoma sips her Mojito down at the Whiskey Bar
Smiles and says she thinks she remembers me from that commercial with the credit card

[Chorus]
Hell, these days there ain't no more, now there’s just again
Tonight the western stars are shining bright again

[Verse 3]
Some days I take my El Camino, throw my saddle in and go
East to the desert where the charros, they still ride and rope
Our American brothers cross the wire and bring the old ways with them
Tonight the western stars are shining bright again

[Verse 4]
Once I was shot by John Wayne, yeah, it was towards the end
That one scene's bought me a thousand drinks, set me up and tell it for you, friend
Here's to the cowboys, riders in the whirlwind
Tonight the western stars are shining bright again
And the western stars are shining bright again

[Chorus]
Tonight the riders on Sunset are smothered in the Santa Ana winds
And the western stars are shining bright again
C'mon and ride me down easy, ride me down easy, friend
'Cause tonight the western stars are shining bright again

[Outro]
I woke up this morning just glad my boots were on
