[Verse 1]
Whoa, thought it was a nightmare, Lord, it's all so true
They told me, don't go walkin' slow, the Devil's on the loose

[Chorus]
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see

[Verse 2]
Thought I heard a rumblin', callin' to my name
Two hundred million guns are loaded, Satan cries, "Take aim"

[Chorus]
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 3]
Over on the mountain, thunder magic spoke
"Let the people know my wisdom, fill the land with smoke"

[Chorus]
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see
