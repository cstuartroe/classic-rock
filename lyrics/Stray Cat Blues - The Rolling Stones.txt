[Intro]
Ah... hey
Yeah, cat's own tail

[Verse 1]
I hear the click-clack of your feet on the stairs
I know you're no scared-eyed honey
There'll be a feast if you just come upstairs

[Refrain]
But it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

[Verse 2]
I can see that you're fifteen years old
No, I don't want your I.D
And I can see that you're so far from home

[Refrain]
But that's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Oh yeah, don't you scratch like that
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
I bet, bet your mama don't know you scream like that
I bet your mother don't know you can spit like that

[Verse 3]
You look so weird, and you're so far from home
Bet you really miss your mother
Don't look so scared I'm no mad-brained bear

[Refrain]
But, but it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Woo!
I bet your mama don't know that you scratch like that
I bet she don't know you can bite like that

[Verse 4]
You say you got a friend, that she's wilder than you
Why don't you bring her upstairs?
If she's so wild, then she can join in too

[Refrain]
It's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Oh yeah, don't you scratch like that
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
I bet you mama don't know you can bite like that
I'll bet she never saw you scratch my back
