[Verse 1]
Now, I just got back from baby's
We've been rolling all night long
Now, I just got back from baby's
We've been rolling all night long
She come on like she loves me
But I feel like something wrong

[Verse 2]
Now, sometime I go see baby
And sometimes she come see me, mmm
I said, sometime I go see baby
And sometimes baby come see me
I got a funny, funny feeling
I'm not the only man she sees
Mmm-hmm, yeah

[Instrumental break 1:46-2:52]

[Verse 3]
Now, I just got back from baby's
A big white house on the hill
I said, I just got back from baby's
A big white house on the hill
If her loving don't get me
I know her husband will
Mmm, yeah

[Instrumental outro 3:28-4:10]
