[Intro, Spoken]
One, two, three, four, five
Four, three, two, one, zero
Ah-ah

[Verse 1]
Reasoned verse, some prose or rhyme
Loses themselves in other times
And waiting hopes cast silent spells
That speak in clouded clues
It cannot be a part of me
For now it's part of you

[Verse 2]
Careful plays on fields
That seem to vanish
When they're in between
And softly as I walk away
In freshly tattered shoes
It cannot be a part of me
For now it's part of you
Na-na-na

[Chorus]
Sunshine, ragtime
Blowing in the breeze
Midnight looks right
Standing more at ease

[Verse 3]
Silhouettes and figures stay
Close to what he had to say
And one more time, the faded dream
Is saddened by the news
It cannot be a part of me
For now it's part of you

[Chorus]
Well, sunshine, ragtime
Blowing in the breeze
Midnight looks right
Standing more at ease

[Chorus]
Sunshine, ragtime
Blowing in the breeze
Midnight looks right
Standing more at ease

[Verse 3, repeated]
Silhouettes and figures stay
Close to what he had to say
And one more time the faded dream
Is saddened by the news
It cannot be a part of me
For now it's part of you
