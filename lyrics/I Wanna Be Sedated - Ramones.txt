[Chorus]
Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do nowhere to go-o-oh
I wanna be sedated

[Verse 1]
Just get me to the airport, put me on a plane
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go insane
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain
Oh no-o-o-o-o

[Chorus]
Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do nowhere to go-o-oh
I wanna be sedated

[Verse 2]
Just put me in a wheelchair, get me on a plane
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go insane
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain
Oh no-o-o-o-o

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do nowhere to go-o-oh
I wanna be sedated

[Verse 3]
Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go loco
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes
Oh no-o-o-o-o

[Chorus]
Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do nowhere to go-o-oh
I wanna be sedated

Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go loco
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes
Oh no-o-o-o-o

[Outro]
Ba ba baba, baba ba baba, I wanna be sedated
Ba ba baba, baba ba baba, I wanna be sedated
Ba ba baba, baba ba baba, I wanna be sedated
Ba ba baba, baba ba baba, I wanna be sedated
