[Verse 1]
Oh, Daddy
You know you make me cry
How can you love me?
I don't understand why

[Chorus]
Oh, Daddy
If I can make you see
If there's been a fool around
It's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me

[Verse 2]
Oh, Daddy
You soothe me with your smile
You're letting me know
You're the best thing in my life

[Chorus]
Oh, Daddy
If I can make you see
If there's been a fool around
It's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me

[Bridge]
Why are you right when I'm so wrong?
(So wrong)
I'm so weak but you're so strong (Ooh)
(Never so strong)
Everything you do is just all right
And I can't walk away from you, baby, if I tried

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Bridge]
Why are you right when I'm so wrong?
(So wrong)
I'm so weak but you're so strong (Ooh)
(Never so strong)
Everything you do is just alright
And I can't walk away from you, baby, if I tried

[Verse 2]
Oh, Daddy
You soothe me with your smile
You're letting me know
You're the best thing in my life

[Chorus]
Oh, Daddy
If I can make you see
If there's been a fool around
It's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me

[Outro]
Yes, it's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me
