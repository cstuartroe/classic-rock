[Verse 1]
Must be getting early
Clocks are running late
Paint by number morning sky looks so phony
Dawn is breaking everywhere
Light a candle, curse the glare
Draw the curtains, I don't care 'cause it's alright

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Verse 2]
I see you've got your fists out, say your piece and get out
Guess I get the gist of it but it's alright
Sorry that you feel that way
The only thing there is to say
Every silver lining's got a touch of grey

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Bridge]
It's a lesson to me
The Deltas and the East and the Freeze
The ABCs we all think of
To try to win a little love

[Verse 3]
I know the rent is in arrears, the dog has not been fed in years
It's even worse than it appears but it's alright
Cow is given kerosene
Kid can't read at seventeen
The words he knows are all obscene but it's alright

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Verse 4]
The shoe is on the hand it fits
There's really nothing much to it
Whistle through your teeth and spit because it's alright
Oh, well, a touch of grey, kind of suits you anyway
That's was all I had to say but it's alright

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Chorus 2]
We will get by
We will get by
We will get by
We will survive
