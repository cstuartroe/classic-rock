[Intro]
This is a public service announcement..with guitar!

[Chorus]
Know your rights
All three of 'em:

[Verse 1]
Number 1
You have the right not to be killed
Murder is a crime
Unless it was done
By a Policeman
Or an aristocrat

[Chorus]
Oh, know your rights

[Verse 2]
And Number 2
You have the right to food money
Providing of course you
Don't mind a little
Investigation, humiliation
And if you cross your fingers
Rehabilitation

[Chorus]
Know your rights
These are your rights
Oh, know these rights

[Verse 3]
Number 3
You have the right to free speech
As long as you're not
Dumb enough to actually try it

[Chorus]
Know your rights
These are your rights
Oh, know your rights
These are your rights
All three of 'em, ha

[Outro]
And it has been suggested
In some quarters that this is not enough
Well, get off the streets
