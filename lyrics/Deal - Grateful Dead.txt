[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until your deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Verse 2]
I been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you all that went down
It would burn off both your ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until your deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
And tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonesome blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show that you don't ever know
Watch each card you play and
Play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until your deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Outro]
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
