Do you know how sad it is to be a man alone
I feel so solitary being in my home without you
I don't know what to do and
I don't know where you are
I can see my life is meant to fall apart some day
Just to be a simple man who sadly goes his way got no girl so
I got no world and
I got no words that I'll say
Hey hey come on make me happy like I've never known before
Say you have ever known no heart fore me anymore
Something new, what's that sound around my heart
I feel something new
I'm sure your love you've given must be real I know now and
I'm sure of how I can be the man I feel
I can be the man I feel
