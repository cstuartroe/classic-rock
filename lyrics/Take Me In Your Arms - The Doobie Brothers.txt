I know you're leaving
Leaving me behind
I'm seeing you, darling
For the very last time

Show a little tenderness
Mama, before you go
Please, let me feel
Your embrace once more

Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, with you, darling
Rock me, rock me a little while

We all must feel
Heartache sometime
Right now, right now
I'm feeling mine

I tried my best to be strong
But I'm not able
I'm like a helpless child
Left in a cradle

Before you leave me
Mama, leave me far behind
Please, let me feel
Happy one more time

Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, with you, darling
Rock me, rock me a little while

I'm losing you
And my happiness
My life is so dark
I must confess

I'll never, never see
Your smiling face no more
I'll never, never hear
Your knock upon my door

Before you leave me
Leave me behind
Please, let me feel
Happy one more time

Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, with you, baby
Rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, yeah yeah

I'm begging, little baby (take me)
Oh baby, please, yeah
(Take me, take me, take me)
Come on, baby (take me)
Can't you see me on my knees now
(Take me, take me, take me)

Come on, baby (take me)
Baby, help, please
(Take me, take me, take me)
Coming to you, baby (take me)
Oh baby, please, please, please

Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, with you, darling
Rock me, rock me a little while
Come on, baby
Rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, with you, darling
Rock me, rock me a little while
