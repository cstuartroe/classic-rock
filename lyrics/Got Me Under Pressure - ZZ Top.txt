[Verse 1]
She likes wearing lipstick
She likes French cuisine
But she won't let me use my passion
Unless it's in a limousine

[Chorus]
She got me under pressure
She got me under pressure

[Verse 2]
She likes the art museum
She don't like Pavlov's dog
She fun at the mind museum
She likes it in a London fog

[Verse 3]
She don't like other women
She likes whips and chains
She likes cocaine
And flipping out with great Danes
She's about all I can handle
It's too much for my brain

[Chorus]
It's got me under pressure
It's got me under pressure

[Instrumental break 1:19-2:15]

[Bridge]
I'm gonna give her a message
Here's what I'm gonna say:
"It's all over"
She might get out a nightstick
And hurt me real, real bad
By the roadside in a ditch

[Chorus]
It's got me under pressure
It's got me under pressure
It's got me under pressure
It's got me under pressure

[Instrumental outro 2:45-4:03]
