[Intro]
Wait until the war is over
And we're both a little older
The unknown soldier

[Chorus]
Breakfast where the news is read
Television, children fed
Unborn living, living dead
Bullet strikes the helmet's head

[Verse 1]
And it's all over for the unknown soldier
It's all over for the unknown soldier, uh uh

March!
Company, halt!
Present arms!

Make a grave for the unknown soldier
Nestled in your hollow shoulder
The unknown soldier

[Chorus]
Breakfast where the news is read
Television, children fed

Bullet strikes the helmet's head

[Bridge]
And it's all over
The war is over
It's all over
War is over

[Outro]
It's all over, baby!
All over, baby!
Oh all right, yeah!
All over, yeah ha ha!
All over!
All over, baby!
Oh, oh yeah!
All over
All over
Yeah
