[Intro]
There will never be
Another one like you
There will never be
Another one who can
Do the things you do, oh

[Chorus]
Will you give another chance?
Will you try, little try?
Please stop and you remember
We were together, anyway, all right

[Verse 1]
And if you have a certain evening
You could lend to me
I'd give it all right back to you
A how it has to be with you
I know your moves and your mind
And your mind[x6]
Will you stop and think and wonder?
Just what you'll see
Out on the train yard
Nursing penitentiary
It's gone, I cry out long
Go head, brother
Did you stop it to consider?
How it will feel
Cold, grinding grizzly bear jaws
Hot on your heels
Do you often stop and whisper?
It's Saturday's shore
The whole world's a savior
Who could ever, ever, ever
Ever, ever, ever
Ask for more?
Do you remember?
Will you stop?
Will you stop?
The pain
And there will never be
Another one like you
There will never be
Another one who can
Do the things you do, oh

[Chorus]
Will you give another chance?
Will you try, little try?
Please stop and you remember
We were together, anyway, all right

[Verse 2]
How you must of think and wondered
How I must feel
Out on the meadows
While you run the field
I'm alone for you
And I cry
The sweat, look at it
Optical promise
Heh, heh, heh
You'll be dead and in hell
Before I'm born
Sure thing
Brides maid
The only solution
Isn't it amazing?
