[Intro]
Aah

[Verse 1]
Did you see your friend crying from his eyes today?
Did you see him run through the streets and far away? (Aah)
Did you see him run? Did you see him fall? (Aah, aah, aah)
Did his life flash by at the bedroom door? (Aah, aah)

[Refrain]
Aah-aha-aha-aha
Aah-aha-aha-aha

[Verse 2]
Did you hear the news? It came across the air today
Someone had been found on the rocks down in the bay (Ahh)
Did you see him hide? Did you see him crawl? (Aah, aah, aah)
Does his life mean more than it did before? (Aah, aah)

[Refrain]
Aah-aha-aha-aha
Aah-aha-aha-aha

[Verse 3]
Did you see that man running through the streets today?
Did you catch his face? Was it 10538?
