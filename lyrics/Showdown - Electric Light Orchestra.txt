[Verse 1]
She cried to the southern wind
'Bout a love that was sure to end
Every dream in her heart was gone
Headin' for a showdown
Bad dreamer, what's your name?
Looks like we're ridin' on the same train
Looks as though there'll be more pain
There's gonna be a showdown

[Chorus]
And it's rainin' all over the world
It's rainin' all over the world
Tonight, the longest night

[Verse 2]
She came to me like a friend
She blew in on a southern wind
Now my heart is turned to stone again
There's gonna be a showdown
Save me
Oh, save me
It's unreal, the suffering
There's gonna be a showdown

[Chorus]
And it's rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
Tonight, the longest night

[Bridge]
(Rainin', rainin')
(Rainin', rainin')

[Chorus]
Rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
The longest night

[Chorus]
And it's rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
Tonight, the longest night

[Outro]
You gotta save me, girl
When I'm ready for savin'
I'm a fool for you
You know I need you, child
Come on and save me
Can't you feel what you're doin' to me now?
I'm on the run again
Gotta save your soul
