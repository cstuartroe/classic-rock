[Verse 1]
Monday morning, you sure look so fine
Friday, I got travelin' on my mind
First you love me, then you fade away
I can't go on believing this way
I got nothing but love for you
So tell me what you really want to do
First you love me, then you get on down the line
But I don't mind
I don't mind

[Chorus]
I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind

[Verse 2]
Monday morning, you sure look so fine
Friday, I got travelin' on my mind
First you love me then you say it's wrong
I can't go on believing for long
But you know it's true (Yes)
You only want me when I get over you
First you love me, then you get on down the line
But I don't mind
I don't mind

[Chorus]
I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind

[Verse 3]
But you know it's true
You only want me when I get over you
First you love me, then you get on down the line
But I don't mind
I don't mind

[Chorus]
I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind
