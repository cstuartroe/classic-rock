[Verse 1]
You look at me with those brown eyes
What do you want to do?
Do you have to have me
The way that I want you? I want you

[Bridge]
Sha-la-lah

[Verse 2]
When you look at me with those brown eyes
What do you want to say?
And are you just another liar?
Will you take me all the way? All the way?

[Outro]
Sha-la-lah
