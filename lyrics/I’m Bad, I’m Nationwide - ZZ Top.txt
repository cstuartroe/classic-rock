[Verse 1]
Well, I was rolling down the road
In some cold blue steel
I had a blues man on the back
And a beautician at the wheel
We going downtown
In the middle of the night
We laughing and I'm joking
And we feeling alright

[Chorus]
Oh I'm bad, I'm nationwide
Yes I'm bad, I'm nationwide

[Verse 2]
Easing down the highway
In a new Cadillac
I had a fine fox in front
I had three more in the back
They sporting short dresses
Wearing spike-heel shoes
They smoking Lucky Strikes
And wearing nylons too

[Chorus]
Cause we bad, we're nationwide
Yeah we bad, we're nationwide

[Instrumental break 1:32-2:43]

[Verse 3]
Well, I was moving down the road
In my V-8 Ford
I had a shine on my boots
I had my sideburns lowered
With my New York brim
And my gold tooth displayed
Nobody give me trouble
Cause they know I got it made

[Chorus]
I'm bad, I'm nationwide
Well, I'm bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, I'm nationwide, yeah, yeah

[Instrumental outro 3:20-4:52]
