Have you seen the saucers?
Have you seen the saucers?

For the earth mother?
Do you know there are people out there
Tranquility base, there goes the neighborhood;
Who are unhappy with the way that we care

American garbage dumped in space
And no room left for brotherhood

Have you seen our saucers?
You see our lights in your western skies

California's rainbow skies;
Your government tells you another missle is flying;
Have you any idea why they're lying
To you, to your faces!
Did they tell you?

Have you seen our saucers?
Her face was pretty but you let her go!
Your mother needs you now she's getting old

Have you seen our saucers?

Star children on the black road to salvation;
You've got to care for the needs of your planet;
Children of the forest and child of the Woodstock nation;
Catch the dawn that once was there;
First born atomic generation;
Open the door

Don't you know that's what it's for?
