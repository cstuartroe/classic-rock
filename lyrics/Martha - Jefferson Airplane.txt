Martha she listens for the ticking of my footsteps, patiently
She sifts the hairy air that's worn and wood-swept, pleasantly
She does as she pleases, she listens for me

Martha she calls to me from a feather in the meadow, "Fly to me"
You can dance and sing and walk with me
And dreams will fade and shadows grow in weed
She does as she pleases, she waits there for me
She does as she pleases, her heels rise for me

My love she talks to winking windows as she murmurs to her feet, thoughtly
She separates in laughter to my side, caught for me
She does as she pleases, she waits there for me
She does as she pleases, her heels rise for me

Martha she keeps her heart in a broken clock and it's waiting there for me
She weeds apart through a token lock; What a great thing to be free
She weeps time, starts unspoken, but when the gate swings there she'll be
There she'll be: in green sun, on blue earth under warm running shower
