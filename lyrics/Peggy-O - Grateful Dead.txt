As we rowed up to Fennario
As we rowed up to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, Pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs Pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs Pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, holding back your yellow hair
In the hand??? ???, William-O
Will you marry me Pretty Peggy-O?
Will you marry me Pretty Peggy-O?
If you will marry me, I will set your cities free
And free all the people of the area-O
I would marry you sweet William-O
I would marry you sweet William-O
I would marry you but your guineas are too few
And I fear my mama would be angry-O
What would your mama think Pretty Peggy-O
What would your mama think Pretty Peggy-O
What would your mama think if she heard my guineas clink
Saw me riding at the head of my soldiers-O
If ever I return Pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return Pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, all your cities I will burn
Destroy all the people in the area-O
Come steppin' down the stairs Pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs Pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, holding back your yellow hair
Bid a last farewell to your William-O
Sweet William he is dead Pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William he is dead Pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William he is dead and he died for a maid
And he spent the loot he had in the country-O
As we rowed up to Fennario
As we rowed up to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, Pretty Peggy-O
