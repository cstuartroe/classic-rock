[Intro]
And the men who hold high places
Must be the ones who start
To mold a new reality
Closer to the heart
Closer to the heart

[Verse 1]
The blacksmith and the artist
Reflect it in their art
They forge their creativity
Closer to the heart
Yeah, it's closer to the heart

[Verse 2]
Philosophers and ploughmen
Each must know his part
To sow a new mentality
Closer to the heart
Yeah, it's closer to the heart
Yeah!  Oh

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You can be the captain
And I will draw the chart
Sailing into destiny
Closer to the heart
Closer to the heart
Closer to the heart
Closer to the heart
Closer to the heart
I said closer to the heart
Closer to the heart
Closer to your heart
Closer to your heart
