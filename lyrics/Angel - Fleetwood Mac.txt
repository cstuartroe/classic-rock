[Verse 1]
Sometimes, the most beautiful things
The most innocent things
And many of those dreams, pass us by
Keep passing me by

[Chorus]
You feel good
I said it's funny that you understood
I knew you would
When you were good, you were very, very good

[Verse 2]
So I close my eyes softly
'Til I become that part of the wind
That we all long for sometime, yeah
And to those that I love, like a ghost through a fog
Like a charmed hour and a haunted song
And the angel of my dreams
Angel of my dreams

[Chorus]
(You said) You feel good
I said it's funny that you understood
I knew you would
When you were good, baby
You were very good

[Verse 3]
I still look up, when you walk in the room
I've the same wide eyes, now they tell the story
I try not to reach out, when you turn 'round you say hello
And we both pretend
I'm no great pretender

[Verse 2]
So I close my eyes softly
'Till I become that part of the wind
That we all long for sometime
And to those that I love, like a ghost through a fog
Like a charmed hour and a haunted song
And the angel, angel of my dreams
Angel of my dreams

[Verse 4]
I still look up
I try hard not to look up, yeah
That girl was me, yeah
Track a ghost through the fog, yeah
A charmed hour and a haunted song

[Outro]
Track a ghost through the fog, baby
Track a ghost through the fog, baby
Ooh, you try hard
But you'll never catch me, yeah
That girl was me
Ooh, you try hard
But you'll never catch me, yeah
