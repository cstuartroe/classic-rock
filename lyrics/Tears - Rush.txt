[Verse 1]
All of the seasons and all of the days
All of the reasons why I've felt this way
So long, so long
Then lost in that feeling I looked in your eyes
I noticed emotion and that you had cried
For me, I can see

[Chorus]
What would touch me deeper
Tears that fall from eyes that only cry?
Would it touch you deeper
Than tears that fall from eyes that know why?

[Verse 2]
A lifetime of questions, tears on your cheek
I tasted the answers and my body was weak
For you, the truth

[Chorus]
What would touch me deeper
Tears that fall from eyes that only cry?
Would it touch you deeper
Than tears that fall from eyes that know why?
