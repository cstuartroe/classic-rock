[Verse 1]
The love line is never straight and narrow
Unless your love is tried and true
We take a chance with new beginnings
Still we try, win or lose
Take the highs with the blues

[Chorus]
Always one more, you're never satisfied
Instead of 'one for all' with you, it's only 'one for me'
Oh, when I draw the line and meet you half the way
But you don't know what that means

I feel like running politician
Just trying to please you all the time
I'm giving you my share with no conditions
Going wide, running long
Feeling lost but not for long

[Chorus]
Always one more, you're never satisfied
Instead of 'one for all' with you, it's only 'one for me'
Oh, when I draw the line and meet you half the way
But you don't know what that means

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Always one more, you're never satisfied
Instead of 'one for all' with you, it's only 'one for me'
Oh, when I draw the line and meet you half the way
But you don't know what that means
