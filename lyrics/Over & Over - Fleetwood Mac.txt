[Verse 1]
Could you ever need me
And would you know how, yeah
Don't waste our time
Tell me now
All you have to do
Is speak out my name, yeah
And I would come running
Anyway

[Chorus][2x]
And I said
Could it be me?
Could it really, really be?
Over and over
Could it really, really be?
Over and over

[Verse 2]
Don't turn me away
And don't let me down
What can I do
To keep you around

[Outro][3x]
Over and over [3x]
