[Intro]
Yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
If I could change the world
Like a fairy tale
I would drink the love
From your Holy Grail
I would start with love
Tell ol' Beelzebub
To get outta town
A-cause you just lost your job
How did we get so affected ('Cause I think)
Love is love reflected

[Chorus]
Time
Don't let it slip away
Raise your drinking glass
Here's to yesterday
In time
We're all gonna trip away
Don't piss Heaven off
We got Hell to pay
Come full circle

[Verse 2]
And if
There's a spell on you that
I could take away
I would do the deed
Yeah, and by the way
A-here's to Heaven knows
As the circle goes
It ain't right
I'm uptight
Yeah, and get off my toes
I used to think that every little thing I did was crazy
But now I think the Karma cops are coming after you

[Chorus]
Time
Don't let it slip away
Raise your drinking glass
Here's to yesterday
In time
We're all gonna trip away
Don't piss Heaven off
We got Hell to pay
Come full circle

[Verse 3]
Every time you get yourself caught up inside
Of someone else's crazy dream
Own it, yeah, that's a mistake
Everybody's gotta lotta nada killing them
Instead of killing time

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Time
Don't let it slip away
Raise your drinking glass
Here's to yesterday
In time
We're all gonna trip away
Don't piss Heaven off
We got Hell to pay

Time
Don't let it slip away
Raise your drinking glass
Here's to yesterday
In time
We're all gonna trip away
Don't piss Heaven off
We got Hell to pay
Come full circle

[Outro]
Circle, circle, circle, circle, circle, circle, circle

Time
Don't let it slip away
Raise your drinking glass
Here's to yesterday
In time
We're all gonna trip away
Don't piss Heaven off
We got Hell to pay
Come full circle
