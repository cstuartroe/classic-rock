[Verse 1]
Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile as a rock & roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well, he can tell you that he tried
I could make a transformation as a rock & roll star

[Chorus]
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock & roll star

[Bridge]
I could do with the money (You know that I could)
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
(You know that I could)
I'd send my photograph to my honey
And I'd c'mon like a regular superstar

[Chorus 2]
I could make a transformation as a rock & roll star

[Chorus 1]
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock & roll star
Get on with the money

[Bridge]
I could do with the money (You know that I could)
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
(You know that I could)
I'd send my photograph to my honey
And I'd c'mon like a regular superstar

[Verse 2]
I could fall asleep at night as a rock & roll star
I could fall in love all right as a rock & roll star

[Outro]
Rock & roll star
Rock & roll star
(Just watch me now)
