[Chorus]
Please believe me
The river told me
Very softly
Want you to hold me, hou-hou-hou

[Verse 1]
Free fall flow, river flow
On and on it goes
Breathe under water till the end

Free fall flow, river flow
On and on it goes
Breathe under water till the end
Yes, the river knows

[Bridge]
Please believe me
If you don't need me
I'm going but I need a little time
I promised I would drown myself in mystic heated wine

Please believe me
The river told me
Very softly
Want you to hold me, hou-hou-hou

[Bridge]
I'm going but I need a little time
I promised I would drown myself in mystic heated wine

[Verse 2]
Free fall flow, river flow
On and on it goes
Breathe under water till the end
Free fall flow, river flow
On and on it goes
Breathe under water till the end
