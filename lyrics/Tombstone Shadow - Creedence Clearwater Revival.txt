[Chorus]
Tombstone shadow, stretching across my path
Tombstone shadow, stretching across my path
Every time I get some good news, Ooh
There's a shadow on my back

[Verse 1]
Saw the gypsy man, 'way down in San Berdoo
Said, I saw the gypsy man, 'way down in San Berdoo
Five dollars on the table, Ooh
Keep me 'way from my tomb
Oh! Oh!
Said I got thirteen months of bad luck
Bound to be some pain
Don't you do no traveling
Fly in no machines

[Chorus]
Tombstone shadow, stretching across my path
Every time I get some good news, Ooh
There's a shadow on my back

[Verse 2]
The man gave me a luck charm, Cost five dollars more
Said, "Put some on your pillow
And put some on your door
He said, "Take a long vacation, Ooh
For thirteen months or more
Oh, Lord!

[Chorus]
Tombstone shadow, stretching across my path
Tombstone shadow, stretching across my path
Every time I get some good news, Ooh
There's a shadow on my back

[Outro]
Oh, oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord!
