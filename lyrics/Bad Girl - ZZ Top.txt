[Intro]
Are you ready?
Let's do it one time!

[Verse 1]
See that girl with the red dress on?
She can do it all night long
She's a bad girl, she's a bad girl
I know a girl that likes to flirt
She's can do it in a mini skirt
She's a bad girl, she's a bad girl
Ain't it a shame when a girl goes bad
It's enough to drive you mad

[Verse 2]
Yesterday I was playing it cool, yeah
But she played me for a first class fool
She's a bad girl, she's a bad girl
I'm gonna tell you like I told some friends
I'm going back to dig her again
She's a bad girl, she's a bad girl
Ain't it a shame when a girl goes bad
She's the one to drive you mad

[Instrumental break 1:24-2:08]

[Verse 3]
I know a girl with a GTO
She's the one that can go, cat go
She's a bad girl, she's a bad girl
See the girl dressed in green
She's the one that's a mean machine
She's a bad girl, she's a bad girl
Ain't it a shame when a girl goes bad
She's enough to drive you mad
Yes she is

[Instrumental outro 2:39-3:22]
