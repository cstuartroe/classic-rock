[Verse 1]
You got a lot of nerve
To say you are my friend
When I was down
You just stood there grinning

[Verse 2]
You got a lot of nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend
You just want to be on
The side that’s winning

[Verse 3]
You say I let you down
You know it’s not like that
If you’re so hurt
Why then don’t you show it?

[Verse 4]
You say you lost your faith
But that’s not where it’s at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it

[Verse 5]
I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
You’re in with

[Verse 5]
Do you take me for such a fool
To think I’d make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What he don’t know to begin with

[Verse 6]
You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say “How are you? Good luck!”
But you don’t mean it

[Verse 7]
When you know as well as me
You’d rather see me paralyzed
Why don’t you just come out once
And scream it

[Verse 8]
No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps I’d rob them

[Verse 9]
And now I know you’re dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don’t you understand
It’s not my problem

[Verse 10]
I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you

[Verse 11]
Yes, I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You’d know what a drag it is
To see you
