[Verse 1]
You tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
The sunny side of the street is dark
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
Maybe that's because it's midnight
In the dark of the moon besides

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
(Maybe the dark is from your eyes) [x3]
You know you got such dark eyes!

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just got to poke around

[Verse 2]
You think you've seen this town clear through
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
Nothing here that could interest you
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
It's not because you missed out
On the thing that we had to start

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maybe you had too much too fast
(Maybe you had too much too fast) [x3]
Or just over played your part

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just got to poke around

[Verse 3]
Since I'm passing your way today
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
I just stopped in because I want to say
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
I recall your darkness
When it crackled like a thundercloud

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart) [x3]
When I can hear it beat out loud!

[Repeat Chorus until fade]
