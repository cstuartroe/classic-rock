[Verse 1]
They say some days you're gonna win
They say some days you're gonna lose
I tell you I got news for you
You're losing all the time, you'll never win, no
If you believe that's how it's gonna be, I'd better put you down
Get off your tightrope up there, come down on the ground
You gotta save me now, you better turn around

[Chorus]
(Woo!)
When I looked around (looked around, woo!)
I was heading down
Won't somebody throw me down a line

[Interlude]
(He-he-hey!)
(He-he-hey!)

[Verse 2]
They say some days you gotta give (He-he-hey!)
They say some days you gotta take (He-he-hey!)
If that's the way it's gotta be (He-he-hey!)
Roll it over and you will see (He-he-hey!)

[Bridge]
The city streets are full of people going nowhere making time
The change from night to day is really only hours
It's just along the line, can't you see the sign

[Chorus]
(Woo!)
When I looked around (looked around, woo!)
I was heading down
Won't somebody throw me down a line

[Verse 3]
I want to look you straight in the eye (He-he-hey!)
I want to tell you how I really feel (He-he-hey!)
I can feel the wheels turning around (He-he-hey!)
Won't somebody throw me down a line (He-he-hey!)

[Bridge]
The city streets are full of people going nowhere making time
The change from night to day is really only hours
It's just along the line, can't you see the sign

[Outro]
(Woo!)
When I closed my eyes (closed my eyes, woo!), I was so surprised
Somebody had thrown me down the line, stopped me drowning
Somebody had thrown me down the line
(Somebody)
