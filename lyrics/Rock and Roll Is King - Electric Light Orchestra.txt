[Thank you for listening.]

[Verse 1]
Well
Listen everybody, let me tell you 'bout the rock n' roll
Ohhh, feel that rhythm and it's really gonna thrill your soul
Mmmm, come along with me, to a land of make-believe
She said, "Whamalamabamalama, rock'n'roll is king."

She loves that rock'n'roll, and she plays it all night long
Awww, that's all she ever tells me when I call her on the telephone
She says, "Feel that jumpin' beat, and a-get up on your feet."
She says, "Whamalamabamalama, rock'n'roll is king."

[Hook]
Oh, let those guitars play
Play for me, play for me
Oh, let that song ring out
That's how it's meant to be

[Verse 2]
Well, it rolls like a train that's a comin' on down the track
She rolled over Beethoven, and she gave Tchaikovsky back
She loves that drivin' beat, and she goes dancin' on down the street
She said, "Whamalamabamalama, rock'n'roll is king."
Aww, rock on!

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Hook]
Oh, let those guitars play
Play for me, play for me
Oh, let that song ring out
That's how it's meant to be

[Verse 3]
Awww, when she comes around and I'm a listenin' to the radio
She says, "You can't do that, cause all I wanna do is rock'n'roll."
"Now here I'm gonna stay, when that music starts to play."
She says, "Whamalamabamalama, rock'n'roll is king."

[Outro]
Aww, yeah, "Whamalamabamalama, rock'n'roll is king."
Uh-huh, "Whamalamabamalama, rock'n'roll is king."
Oooh, yeah, "Whamalamabamalama, rock'n'roll is king."
She said, "Whamalamabamalama, rock'n'roll is king"
