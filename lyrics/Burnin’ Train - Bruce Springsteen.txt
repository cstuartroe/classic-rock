[Verse 1]
Zero’s my number
Time is my hunter
I wanted you to heal me
But instead you set me on fire

We were out over the borders
I washed you in holy water
We whispered our black prayers
And rose up in flames

[Refrain]
Take me on your burnin’ train
Take me on your burnin’ train

[Verse 2]
White sun burnin’
Black wings beatin’
I ran my fingers ‘cross the hollow of your stomach
As you lay breathing

With our shared faith
Rising dark and decayed
Take me and shake me from this mortal cage

[Refrain]
Takе me on your burnin’ train
Take me on your burnin’ train

[Bridge]
Somеthing’s shining in the light ‘neath your breast
The thick smell of you on my chest

[Verse 3]
On your bed of thorns
I brought you shining gifts
Wiped the sweat from your brow
And I touched your lips

Sheets stained with sweat
Outside the endless rain
Darlin’ I’m blessed in your blood
And marked by Cain

[Refrain]
Take me on your burnin’ train
Take me on your burnin’ train
Take me on your burnin’ train
