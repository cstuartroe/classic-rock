[Verse 1]
Everything about her was natural
Everything about her was cool
But I'm a little partial for beautiful girls
Even if they blood runs blue

[Chorus]
I think I see her
I think I want her
I think I love her
She's just killing me
I think she's killing me

[Verse 2]
Her castanets are enormous
Her bongo beat absolute
And when she doing midnight performances
She's got a secret something to boot

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Miss Satanic Pandemonia
Don't get any lower or slower
What you see is what you get conmigo
And the bonus of an albino boa

[Chorus]
I think I see her
I think I want her
Yes, I think I love her
She's just killing me
She's just killing me
(That's some time I had)
I think I see her
I know I love her
Yes, I might love her
She's just killing me
She wanna be killing me
(Suck my blood)
