[Verse 1: The Kinks]
I know a man, he's a powerful man
He's got the people in his power in the palm of his hand
He started at the bottom and he worked his way up
Now he's never going to stop until he reaches the top

[Chorus 1: The Kinks]
It's the same old story
It's the same old dream
It's powerman, powerman, and all that it can bring

[Verse 2: The Kinks]
If you want your money, you better stand in the line
'Cause you'll only end up picking up the nickels and dimes
You call him names and he sits and grins
'Cause everybody else is just a sucker to him

[Chorus 2: The Kinks]
And he's got my money
But I've got my faith
And powerman, powerman, I'll never be your slave
It's the same old story
It's the same old game
Powerman, powerman, he's driving me insane

[Bridge: The Kinks]
People tried to conquer the world
Napoleon and Genghis Khan
Hitler tried and Mussolini too
Powerman don't need to fight
Powerman don't need no guns
Powerman got money on his side

[Verse 3: The Kinks]
Well I'm not rich and I'm not free
But I've got my girl and she got me
He's got my money and my publishing rights
But I've got my girl and I'm alright

[Chorus 3: The Kinks]
And she's got me going
And she keeps me sane
Powerman, powerman, got money on the brain
It's the same old story
It's the same old game
Powerman, powerman, he's driving me insane
