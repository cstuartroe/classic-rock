[Chorus]
I'm looking for a reason to stay
I'm all wound up and tied in knots today
I'm looking for a reason not to go
When the morning comes, I'll be on my way

[Verse 1]
Every night I ask myself again
Just what it was that made our dream begin
It seemed like a good idea way back then
But I'm wondering now what daydream took me in

[Chorus]

[Verse  2]
Yesterday I tried once more to find
A way to share the trouble on my mind
It seems like you turn away every time
I used to like it here, I can't remember why

[Chorus][2x]
