[Verse 1]
The judge decreed it, the clerk he wrote it
Clerk he wrote it down indeed-e
Judge decreed it, clerk he wrote it down
Give you this jail sentence, you'll be Nashville bound

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Some got six months, some got one solid
Some got one solid year indeed-e
Some got six months, some got one solid, yeah
But me and my buddies all got lifetime here

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I wrote a letter, I mailed in the...mailed it in the air indeed-e
I wrote a letter, I mailed in the air
You may know by that I've got a friend somewhere

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3 repeated]
I wrote a letter, I mailed in the...mailed it in the air indeed-e
I wrote a letter, I mailed in the air
You may know by that I've got a friend somewhere
