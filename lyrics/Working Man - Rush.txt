[Verse 1]
Well, I get up at seven, yeah
And I go to work at nine
I got no time for livin’
Yes, I’m workin’ all the time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It seems to me I could live my life
A lot better than I think I am
I guess that’s why they call me
They call me the workin’ man

[Chorus]
They call me the workin' man
I guess that's what I am

[Verse 2]
Yes, I get home at five o'clock
And I take myself out an ice cold beer
Always seem to be wond'rin'
Why there's nothin' goin' down here

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It seems to me I could live my life
A lot better than I think I am
I guess that's why they call me
The workin' man

[Chorus]
Well, they call me the workin' man
I guess that's what I am

[Chorus]
Well, they call me the workin' man
I guess that's what I am

[Instrumental break 2:05-5:28]

[Verse 1]
Well, I get up at seven, yeah
And I go to work at nine
I got no time for livin'
Yes, I'm workin' all the time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It seems to me I could live my life
A lot better than I think I am
I guess that's why they call me
They call me the workin' man

[Chorus]
Well, they call me the workin' man
I guess that's what I am
They call me the workin' man
I guess that's what I am
