[​Intro]

[Verse 1]
You got me running, going out of my mind
You got me thinking that I'm wasting my time

[Chorus]
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

[Verse 2]
You wanna stay out with your fancy friends
I'm telling you, it's got to be the end

[Chorus]
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

[Hook]
Don't bring me down, Groos
Don't bring me down, Groos
Don't bring me down, Groos
Don't bring me down

[Verse 3]
What happened to the girl I used to know?
You let your mind out somewhere down the road

[Chorus]
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

[Verse 4]
You're always talking 'bout your crazy nights
One of these days, you're gonna get it right

[Chorus]
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

[Hook]
Don't bring me down, Groos
Don't bring me down, Groos
Don't bring me down, Groos
Don't bring me down

[Verse 5]
You're looking good, just like a snake in the grass
One of these days, you're gonna break your glass

[Chorus]
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

[​Verse 6]
You got me shaking, got me running away
You got me crawling up to you everyday

[Chorus]
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down, down, down, down, down, down

[​Outro]
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down
