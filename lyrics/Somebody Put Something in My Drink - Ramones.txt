[Intro]
Somebody
Somebody put something in my drink, somebody

[Verse 1]
Another night out on the street
Stopping for my usual seat
Oh, bartender, please
Tanqueray and tonic's my favorite drink
I don't like anything colored pink, that just stinks
It's not for me

[Chorus 1]
It feels like somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something

[Verse 2]
Blurred vision and dirty thoughts
Feel evasive, very distraught
Feel something coming on
Kick the jukebox, slam the floor
Drink, drink, drink, drink some more
I can't think, hey, what's in that drink?

[Chorus 2]
It feels like somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something

[Post-Chorus]
In my drink, in my drink
In my drink, in my drink

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
So, you think it's funny? A college prank?
Going insane from sipping your drink
Feel a little dry
Oh, I couldn't care what you think of me
'Cause somebody put something in my drink
I can't think, hey, give me a drink

[Chorus 2]
It feels like somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink

[Outro]
Somebody put something (In my drink)
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something (In my drink)
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something (In my drink)
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something (In my drink)
Somebody put something in my drink
