Lady, you keep asking
Why he likes you how come
Wonder why he wants more
If he just had some
Boys, she's got more
To play with in the way of toys
Ladies eyes go off and on with a finger full of glue
Lips are drawn upon her face in come-to-me tattoo
Creamy suntan color that
Fades when she bathes
Paper dresses catch on fire
And you lose her in the haze
Don't ever change lady
He likes you that way
Because he just had his hair done and he wants to use your wig
He's going off the drug thing cause his veins are getting big
He wants to sell his paintings
But the market is slow
They're only paying him two grams now
For a one-man abstract show

Don't ever change people
Even if you can
You are your own best toy to play with
Remote control hands
Made for each other
Made in Japan
Woman with a greasy
Heart automatic man
Don't ever change people
Your face will hit the fan
Don't ever change people
Even if you can
Don't change before the empire falls
You'll laugh so hard you'll crack the walls
