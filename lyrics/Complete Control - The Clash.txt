[Verse 1]
They said, "Release 'Remote Control'"
But we didn't want it on the label
They said, "Fly to Amsterdam"
The people laughed, but the press went mad
Oh, someone's really smart
Oh, complete control, yeah that's a laugh

[Verse 2]
On the last tour my mates they couldn't get in
I'd open up the back door but they'd get run out again
And at every hotel we was a'met by the law
Come for the party, come to make sure
Oh, have we done something wrong?
Oh, complete control, even over this song

[Bridge]
You’re my guitar hero

[Chorus]
They said we'd be artistically free
When we signed that bit of paper
They meant "Let's make a lots of money
And worry about it later"
Oh, I'll never understand
Oh, complete control, let me see your other hand

[Verse 3]
I don’t trust you, so why should you trust me?
Huh?
All over the news spread fast
They’re dirty, they're filthy, they ain't a'gonna last
This is Joe Public (Control) speaking
I'm controlled in the body (C-O-N control)
Controlled in the mind
This is the top rockers (Control)
With your zone in the price you whore (C-O-N control)
Comes to me

[Bridge]
Total, C-O-N control
Total, (parent, control) C-O-N control

[Outro]
We’ve got the rock ‘n’ roll (C-O-N control)
That means you
I kick it, I fight it, I gotta get up at it (C-O-N control)
I gotta kick it
