[Verse 1]
The moment you realize
Those moments just pass you by
Gonna take you to paradise

[Pre-Chorus]
Move it
Make you prove it, yeah
Breakin' out
Break it down
Feel the chills, feel the chills
Movin' down your spine

[Chorus]
When we recall and
Realize
Make you realize
I've got the power to hypnotize
Make a play, mesmerize
Feel the chills up and down your spine
I'm gonna make you fly

[Verse 2]
Your eye's playin' tricks on you
Your mind will seek the truth
You know you're gonna make it through

[Pre-Chorus]
I said move it
Makе you prove it
Shake it up, shake it down
Feel thе chills, feel the chills
Movin' down your spine

[Chorus]
When we recall and
Realize
Gonna make you realize
I got the power to electrify
Make a play to satisfy
Feel a chill up and down your spine
I'm gonna make you fly
Fly, fly

[Solo]

[Chorus]
When we recall and
Realize
Gonna make you realize
I got the power to hypnotize
Make a play, mesmerize
Feel the chills up and down your spine
I'm gonna make you fly
