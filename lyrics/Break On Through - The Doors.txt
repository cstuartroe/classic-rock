[Verse]
You know the day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Tried to run
Tried to hide

[Hook]
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side, yeah

[Verse 2]
We chased our pleasures here
Dug our treasures there
But can you still recall
The time we cried?

[Hook]
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side

[Break]
Everybody loves my baby
Everybody loves my baby
She get, she get
She get, she get high

[Verse 3]
I found an island in your arms
Country in your eyes
Arms that chain
Eyes that lie

[Hook]
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, auh, oh, yeah

[Outro]
Made the scene, week to week
Day to day, hour to hour
The gate is straight
Deep and wide
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, break on through
Break on through, break on through
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey
