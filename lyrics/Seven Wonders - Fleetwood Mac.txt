[Verse 1]
So long ago
Certain place
Certain time
You touched my hand
On the way
On the way down to Emmeline

[Pre-Chorus]
But if our paths never cross
Well, you know I'm sorry, but

[Chorus]
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

[Post-Chorus]
The rainbow's edge
(Aaron)
(Aaron)

[Verse 2]
So it's hard to find
Someone with that kind of intensity
You touched my hand, I played it cool
And you reached out your hand to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But if our paths never cross
Well, no, I'm not sorry, but

[Chorus]
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

[Post-Chorus]
The rainbow's edge
(Aaron)
(Aaron)

[Verse 3]
So long ago
It's a certain time
It's a certain place
You touched my hand and you smiled
All the way back you held out your hand

[Bridge]
If I hope and if I pray
Ooh, it might work out someday

[Chorus]
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

If I live to see the seven wonders (if I live to see the seven wonders)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end (I'll make a path there)
I'll never live to match the beauty again (I'll never live to see that beauty, that beauty, that same same beauty again)

If I live to see the seven wonders (if I live to see the)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
(Well if I hope and I pray)
(Well maybe it might work out someday)

If I live to see the seven wonders (if I live to see the seven wonders)
