[Verse 1]
Just like Jack the Ripper, just like Mojo Hand
Just like Billy Sunday, in a shotgun ragtime band
Just like New York City, just like Jericho
Pace the halls and climb the walls and get out when they blow

[Chorus 1]
Did you say your name was Ramblin Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose

[Verse 2]
Just like Jack and Jill, Mama told the sailor
One heat up, and one cool down, leave nothing for the tailor
Just like Jack and Jill, Papa told the jailer
One go up, and one go down, do yourself a favor

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
I'm going to sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never going to end
I'm going to  march you up and down along the county line
Take you to the leader of a band

[Verse 3]
Just like Crazy Otto, just like Wolfman Jack
Sittin' plush with a royal flush, aces back to back
Just like Mary Shelly, just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains and count your change and try to walk the line

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 4]
Goodbye Mama and Papa
Goodbye Jack and Jill
The grass ain't greener
The wine ain't sweeter
Either side of the hill

[Chorus]
