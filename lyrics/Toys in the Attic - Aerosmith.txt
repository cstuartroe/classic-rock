[Intro]
In the attic, lights
Voices scream
Nothing seen
Real's the dream

[Verse]
Leaving the things that are real behind
Leaving the things that you love from mind
All of the things that you learned from fears
Nothing is left for the years

Voices scream
Nothing seen
Real's the dream

[Chorus]
Toys, toys, toys, in the attic
Toys, toys, toys, in the attic
Toys, toys, toys, in the attic
Toys, toys, toys, in the attic

[Intro]
Lights
Voices scream
Nothing seen
Real's the dream

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse]
Leaving the things that are real behind
Leaving the things that you love from mind
All of the things that you learned from fears
Nothing is left for the years

Voices scream
Nothing seen
Real's the dream

[Outro]
Toys, toys, toys, in the attic
Toys, toys, toys, in the attic
Toys, toys, toys, in the attic
Toys, toys, toys, in the attic

Toys, toys, toys, we're in the attic
Toys, toys, toys, we're in the attic
Toys, toys, toys, in the attic
Toys, toys, toys, in the attic
