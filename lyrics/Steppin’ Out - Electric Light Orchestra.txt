[Verse 1]
Pack up all your things
We're gonna be leavin'
Sooner than I thought
Take the things you bought
Clouds are gathering
Say goodbye to all your friends
We're gonna be sorry
For a while, that's how it goes
But then again, who knows
About the rain?

[Chorus]
I'm steppin' out, I'm moving on
I'm gonna see the world
Like a rolling stone
I'm steppin' out
I'm gonna be somebody...
Ooh, I'm steppin' out

[Verse 2]
Did you hear what he said?
He said they sold me down the river
They thought I thought I was a fool
They said the rain would fall
What did they know?
Then I saw your face
Heard the song that you were singin'
Though I thought I knew the words
The tune was quite absurd
And out of key
Doo-dah-dah-dee

[Chorus]
I'm steppin' out, I'm moving on
I'm gonna see the world
Like a rolling stone
I'm steppin' out
I'm gonna be somebody...
Ooh, I'm steppin' out

I'm steppin' out, I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out, I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out, I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out, I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out, I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out, I'm steppin' out

Steppin' out
Steppin' out
Steppin' out

Don't know where I'm going
Gonna see the world
Gonna be somebody...
Don't know where I'm going
I'm just steppin' out
I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out
