[Verse 1]
Dark star crashes
Pouring its light
Into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose
From the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the
Clouds of delusion

[Chorus]
Shall we go
You and I
While we can?
Through
The transitive nightfall
Of diamonds

[Verse 2]
Mirror shatters
In formless reflections
Of matter
Glass hand dissolving
To ice petal flowers
Revolving
Lady in velvet
Recedes
In the nights of goodbye

[Chorus]
Shall we go
You and I
While we can?
Through
The transitive nightfall
Of diamonds
