[Verse 1]
It's three o'clock in the morning
And the rain begin to fall
But I know what I'm needing
But I don't have it all
I'm needing someone like you
That I just wanna do love to
Baby, baby, I need you tonight

[Verse 2]
Outside my window
It's lonely and cold
Inside my heart there's a fire
Burning out of control
Burning for someone like you
I just wanna do love to
Baby, baby, I need you tonight

[Instrumental break 2:01-3:24]

[Verse 3]
Your love's coming to me
Like a wolf howling at the moon
But that just doesn't do me
If I can't get you soon
I'm calling for someone like you
That I just wanna do love to
Baby, baby, I need you tonight

[Instrumental outro 4:00-6:18]
