[Chorus]
I brought an ounce that I can burn down (Down)
Bad bitch and I got her down
Call up your friend
Tell her come down
That’s that shit that I can't turn down
If they say there's a party, I'm down (Down)
My partners all tell me, “Slow down” (Down)
But when they all say that there's money around
That’s the shit that I can't turn down
I can't turn down (Down, down)
Weed too loud but I can't turn down
I can't turn down (Down, down)
Way too high but I can't turn down
I can't turn down (Down, down)
Squad goin’ up and we can't turn down
We can't turn down (Down, down)
Can't turn down
Turn up

[Verse 1]
Big homie told me, “Be patient and don't get complacent”
Show dedication
I'm at work so much, I go home on vacation
No money, no conversation
The throne is my sole motivation
My goal’s domination
Ain’t needing no co-sign or statement, just payments
Could fit your whole home in my basement
You’re basic
Money come back like a echo (Echo, echo, echo)
High as falsetto
Watch these boys lie like Geppetto
Please, tell yo’ girl I said hello
Last level, that’s boss mode
I've been on, no off mode
I chose wrong at each crossroad
But still got here and you’re lost, bro
These sessions are session
I live like I'm gon' be dead any second
Gone for a minute but never be second
It’s skies to the limit, forever he reppin’
High like I'm up on a pedestal
Weed is on stereo
Need some? Then let me know
I'm smokin’ that medical
You smokin’ Mexico
Boy, you already know

[Chorus]
I brought an ounce that I can burn down (Down)
Bad bitch and I got her down
Call up your friend
Tell her come down
That’s that shit that I can't turn down
If they say there's a party, I'm down (Down)
My partners all tell me, “Slow down” (Down)
But when they all say that there's money around
That’s the shit that I can't turn down
I can't turn down (Down, down)
Weed too loud but I can't turn down
I can't turn down (Down, down)
Way too high but I can't turn down
I can't turn down (Down, down)
Squad goin’ up and we can't turn down
We can't turn down (Down, down)
Can't turn down
So turn up

[Verse 2]
I'm at the Delano
As high as you get, that’s soprano
I just got back from Cabo
I'm smokin’ this new shit that’s from Colorado
Get money, the motto
Your girl checkin’ me and she wet as The Grotto
Does she spit or swallow?
I don’t know, but when I find out, I'll let you know tomorrow
That’s mean
Fuck it, I'm cold
Zero degrees, no love for these hoes
Never believin’ in nothin’ I’m told
They lookin’ at me like I’m covered in gold
Oh, so funny how things change, ain't it?
But remain hated, I'm your bae's favourite
Late, but I made it
My timin’ ain't great
But whatever’s at stake, I’ma take it, just face it
Truth is I've been too patient
My future's bright but I get too faded
I'm like Tyler Durden, came from Lou’s basement
No suits and ties
Plenty suitcases
Got old friends that got new cases
And I hope to beat ‘em like two aces
Can't turn down
That’s a true statement
Need Backwood’s, like two cases

[Chorus]
I brought an ounce that I can burn down (Down)
Bad bitch and I got her down
Call up your friend
Tell her come down
That’s that shit that I can't turn down
If they say there's a party, I'm down (Down)
My partners all tell me, “Slow down” (Down)
But when they all say that there's money around
That’s the shit that I can't turn down
I can't turn down (Down, down)
Weed too loud but I can't turn down
I can't turn down (Down, down)
Way too high but I can't turn down
I can't turn down (Down, down)
Squad goin’ up and we can't turn down
We can't turn down (Down, down)
Can't turn down
So turn up

[Refrain]
Can’t turn down
We can’t turn down (Down, down)
Can’t turn down
We can’t turn down (Down, down)
Turn up
Can’t turn down
We can’t turn down (Down, down)
Can’t turn down
We can’t turn down (Down, down)
Turn up
T-Turn up
Turn up
T-T-T-Turn up
T-T-Turn up
