[Verse 1]
When I woke up this morning
I was feeling mighty good
My baby understood had to do what she should
Lying near a pile of wood

[Chorus]
Laying it on some
Playing with it some
When I, I woke up with wood

[Verse 2]
I was lying there thinking about basketball
Trying not to lose my mind
My baby came to help and I let out a yell
She grabbed me from behind

[Chorus]
Laying it on some
Playing with it some
When I, I woke up with wood

[Verse 3]
Beauty queens fall in trances
Debutantes lose their furs
But it felt so good from where they stood
They were working on a pile of wood

[Chorus]
Laying it on some
Playing with it some
When I, I woke up with wood
