[Intro]
Is this on?
Okay, after four!
Four!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I used to think she was the greatest thing
I really cared, gave her a diamond ring
She said, she'd rather die than ever leave me
Well, I never saw her face since then

[Hook 1]
And if the law don't get her, then I will
Four little diamonds

[Verse 2]
She must be somewhere on the open road
She always said she was a lonely one
She gets you down with her tales of woe (Woe)
She took me for everything

[Hook 2]
And if the law don't get her, then I will
Four little diamonds
(Ooh) Four little diamonds

[Bridge 1]
I looked around, I climbed up high into the dawn
But she was gone with the night
I thought about the things she said
And all the things we'd done
But where could she run?
There's just no answer to give

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I keep on wonderin' 'bout her, day and night
She probably thinks I was a fool, she's right
She don't know it, but I'm gonna keep on searchin' for that woman
I'm gonna search everywhere

[Hook 2]
And if the law don't get her, then I will
Four little diamonds
(Ooh) Four little diamonds

[Bridge 2]
I looked around, I climbed up high into the dawn
But she was gone with the night
I thought about the things she said
And all the things we'd done
But she ran away (Ooh)
There's just no answer to give

[Instrumental]

[Reprise]
I still hear her callin' out to me
I still listen for her endlessly
But it never even crossed my mind, she was a cheater
I gotta find where she hides

[Hook 3]
'Cause if the law don't get her, then I will
Four little diamonds
Said if the law don't get her, then I will
Four little diamonds
Said if the law don't get her, then I will
Four little diamonds

[Outro]
Four little diamonds
Four little diamonds
Four little diamonds
Four little diamonds
(Hey!) Four little diamonds
(Hey!) Four little diamonds
