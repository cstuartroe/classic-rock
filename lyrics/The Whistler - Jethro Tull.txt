[Verse 1]
I'll buy you six bay mares to put in your stable ---
Six golden apples bought with my pay
I am the first piper who calls the sweet tune
But I must be gone by the seventh day

[Chorus]
So come on, I'm the whistler
I have a fife and a drum to play
Get ready for the whistler
I whistle along on the seventh day ---
Whistle along on the seventh day

[Verse 2]
All kinds of sadness I've left behind me
Many's the day when I have done wrong
But I'll be yours for ever and ever
Climb in the saddle and whistle along

[Chorus]
So come on, I'm the whistler
I have a fife and a drum to play
Get ready for the whistler
I whistle along on the seventh day ---
Whistle along on the seventh day

[Verse 3]
Deep red are the sun-sets in mystical places
Black are the nights on summer-day sands
We'll find the speck of truth in each riddle
Hold the first grain of love in our hands

[Chorus]
So come on, I'm the whistler
I have a fife and a drum to play
Get ready for the whistler
I whistle along on the seventh day ---
Whistle along on the seventh day
