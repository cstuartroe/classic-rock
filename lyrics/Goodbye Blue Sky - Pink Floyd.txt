[Spoken Intro: Harry Waters]
Look Mummy
There's an airplane up in the sky

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Did you see the frightened ones?
Did you hear the falling bombs?
Did you ever wonder
Why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world
Unfurled beneath the clear blue sky?

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Did you see the frightened ones?
Did you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all long gone, but the pain lingers on

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye
Goodbye
