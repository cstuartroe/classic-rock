[Chorus]
Winter is here and it's going on two years
Swallow my pride
Things were looking grim but they're looking good again
Swallow my pride

[Verse 1]
Loose lips sink ships, they say
But isn't it always that way?
Swallow my pride, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Winter is here and it's going on two years
Swallow my pride
Things were looking grim but they're looking good again
Swallow my pride

[Verse 2]
Going to have a real cool time
And everything's going to be real fine
Swallow my pride, oh yeah
