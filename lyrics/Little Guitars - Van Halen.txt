Senorita, I'm in trouble again
And I can't get free (Senorita)
You're exactly what the doctor ordered
Come and talk to me
(Ah) Can't crow before I'm outta the woods but there's exceptions to the rule
(Ah) Senorita do you need a friend, I'm in love with you

Catch as catch, catch as catch can
Anybody in their right mind could see
It's you and me
Oooh

You say you're lonesome just getting by
But you turn your eyes from me
Be sure you're hurting long before you fly
'Cause you got me

Catch as catch, catch as catch can
Anybody in their right mind could see
You and me
Catch as catch, catch as catch can
Yeah when I see you and your little guitars sing to me

I can see you don't know which way to turn
But the sun still shines (Senorita)
Don't you know that you can dance with me
Any time
(Ah) Can't crow before I'm outta the woods but there's exceptions to the rule
(Ah) Senorita do you need a friend, I'm in love with you
Oh oh oh oooh oh
Oh oh oh oooh
