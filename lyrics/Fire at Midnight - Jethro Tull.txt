[Verse 1]
I believe in fires at midnight
When the dogs have all been fed
A golden toddy on the mantle
A broken gun beneath the bed

Silken mist outside the window
Frogs and newts slip in the dark
Too much hurry ruins a body
I'll sit easy, fan the spark

[Verse 2]
Kindled by the dying embers
Of another working day
Go upstairs, take off your makeup
Fold your clothes neatly away

Me, I'll sit and write this love song
As I all too seldom do
Build a little fire this midnight
It's good to be back home with you

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Kindled by the dying embers
Of another working day
Go upstairs, take off your makeup
Fold your clothes neatly away

Me, I'll sit and write this love song
As I all too seldom do
Build a little fire this midnight
It's good to be back home with you
