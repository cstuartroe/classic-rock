[Chorus]
Bootleg, Bootleg
Bootleg, Howl
Bootleg, Bootleg
Bootleg, Howl

[Verse 1]
Take you a glass of water
Make it against the law
See how good the water tastes
When you can't have any at all

[Chorus]
Bootleg, Bootleg
Bootleg, Howl
Bootleg, Bootleg
Bootleg, Howl

[Verse 2]
Finding a natural woman
Like honey to a bee
But you don't buzz the flower
When you know the honey's free

[Chorus]
Bootleg, Bootleg
Bootleg, Howl
Bootleg, Bootleg
Bootleg, Howl

[Verse 3]
Suzy maybe give you some cherry pie
But Lord, that ain't no fun
Better you grab it when she ain't looking
Because you know you'd rather have it on the run

[Chorus]
Bootleg, Bootleg
Bootleg, Howl
Bootleg, Bootleg
Bootleg, Howl
