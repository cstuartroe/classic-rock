[Intro]
Wish I was, yeah, a Wild West hero

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I look up high
And then I think there might
Just be a better life
Away from all we know
That's where I wanna go
Out on the wild side
And I wish I was
Oh-oh-oh-oh, a Wild West hero

[Chorus]
Ride the range all the day
Till the first fading light
Be with my western girl
Round the fire oh so bright
I'd be the Indians' friend
Let them live to be free
Ridin' into the sunset
I wish I could be

[transition music]

[Verse 2]
I'd ride the desert sands
And through the prairie lands
Tryin' to do what's right
The folks would come to me
They'd say, "We need you here."
I'd stay there for the night
Oh, I wish I was
Oh-oh-oh-oh, a Wild West hero

[Chorus]
Ride the range all the day
Till the first fading light
Be with my western girl
Round the fire oh so bright
I'd be the Indians' friend
Let them live to be free
Ridin' into the sunset
I wished I could be

[transition music]

[Bridge]
Oh, I wish I was
Oh-oh-oh-oh, a Wild West hero
I wish I was
Oh-oh-oh-oh, a Wild West hero
Oh, I wish I was
Oh-oh-oh-oh, a Wild West hero
Wish I was
Oh-oh-oh-oh, a Wild West hero

Wish I was, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, a Wild West hero
