He's just an American boy
He loves his machine
No back talk from a machine
When was the last time a television set
Gave you any shit about
Who you met last night?
No back talk from a machine

Now if your motor doesn't turn over for you, well
You don't feed it right
Give it a little grease
Give it a little gas
Drive straight on through the night
Man-made mechanical mover
Love your machine

You say nothing's right but natural things
Ah, you fool
Poison oak is a natural plant
Why don't you put some in your food?
Natural food makes you slow and stupid and it tastes like cabbage
I don't care if there's chemicals in it
As long as my lettuce is crisp
Preservatives might be preserving you all
I think that's something you might've...
Oh, I think you might've missed it
Yeah, you missed it

Man-made mechanical mover
And I love his machine
Smooth-moving steel

He's just an American man
He loves his machine
Oh, no back talk from a machine
And I love his machine
It's a-
Smooth moving steel

Well, now, keep your engine warm and wet
Be friendly to your steel
Feed it right
Mechanical pet
And then get behind the wheel
Put a little starch in the old Corvette
And then give it a feel
Oooh, smooth moving steel
Give it a feel

Man-made mechanical mover
It'll move faster than you can
Vegetable lover
