'There's a high flyin' bird, flying way up in the sky
And I wonder if she looks down, as she goes on by?
Well, she's flying so freely in the sky
Lord, look at me here
I'm rooted like a tree here
Got those sit-down
Can't cry Oh Lord, gonna die blues
Now the sun it comes up and lights up the day
And when he gets tired, Lord, he goes on down his way
To the east and to the west
He meets God every day
Lord, look at me here
I'm rooted like a tree here
Got those sit-down, can't cry
Oh Lord, gonna die blues
Now I had a woman
Lord, she lived down by the mine
She ain't never seen the sun
Oh Lord, never stopped crying
Then one day my woman up and died
Lord, she up and died now
Oh Lord, she up and died now
She wanted to die
And the only way to fly is die, die, die
There's a high flyin' bird, flying way up in the sky
And I wonder if she looks down as she goes on by?
Well, she's flying so freely in the sky
Lord, look at me here
I'm rooted like a tree here
Got those sit-down, can't cry
Oh, Lord, gonna die blues.'
