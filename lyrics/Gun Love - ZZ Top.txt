She likes to shoot her gun
Shootin' at the target of love
She likes to load her chamber
Hot and tight like a black leather glove
She's a little freak, but she'll take you in
You might be sittin' at the end of a firing pin
Gun love, gun love, gun love
She's a real gun lover
Gun love, gun love, gun love
She's a real gun lover tonight

She's so particular, she likes a Smith and Wesson or Colt
But she'll give you some lovin' as long as she's cockin' the bolt
Better hold on when she's up to her tricks
Playin' Russian Roulette but she'll load all six
Gun love, gun love, gun love
She's a real gun lover
Gun love, (gun love) gun love, (gun love) gun love
She's a real gun lover tonight

She likes the punch deep down in her pistolero
Running with the wild bunch, makin' like a Robert Dinero
She's kinda shy but make no mistake
She'll shoot you full of love till your love bone aches
Gun love, gun love, gun love
She's a real gun lover
Gun love, (gun love) gun love, gun love
She's a real gun lover tonight
She's a real gun lover
She's a real gun lover tonight
