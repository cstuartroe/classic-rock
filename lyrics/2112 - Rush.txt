[Verse 1]
We've taken care of everything
The words you read, the songs you sing
The pictures that give pleasure to your eye
It's one for all, and all for one
We work together, common son
Never need to wonder how or why

[Chorus]
We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx
Our great computers fill the hallowed halls
We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx
All the gifts of life are held within our walls

[Verse 2]
Look around at this world we've made
Equality our stock in trade
Come and join the Brotherhood of Man
Oh what a nice, contented world
Let the banners be unfurled
Hold the Red Star proudly high in hand

[Chorus]
We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx
Our great computers fill the hallowed halls
We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx
All the gifts of life are held within our walls

[Instrumental break 6:25-8:25]

[Verse 1]
What can this strange device be?
When I touch it, it gives forth a sound
It's got wires that vibrate and give music
What can this thing be that I found?

[Verse 2]
See how it sings like a sad heart
And joyously screams out its pain
Sounds that build high like a mountain
Or notes that fall gently like rain

[Verse 3]
I can't wait to share this new wonder
The people will all see its light
Let them all make their own music
The Priests praise my name on this night

[Verse 1]
I know it's most unusual
To come before you so
But I've found an ancient miracle
I thought that you should know
Listen to my music
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you

[Verse 2]
Yes, we know, it's nothing new
It's just a waste of time
We have no need for ancient ways
The world is doing fine
Another toy that helped destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the plan, no

[Chorus]
I can't believe you're saying
These things just can't be true
Our world could use this beauty
Just think what we might do
Listen to my music
And hear what it can do
There's something here that's as strong as life
I know that it will reach you

[Verse 4]
Don't annoy us further!
Oh, we have our work to do
Just think about the average
What use have they for you?
Another toy that helped destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the plan!

[Verse 1]
I wandered home though silent streets
And fell into a fitful sleep
Escape to realms beyond the night
Dream, can't you show me the light?

[Verse 2]
I stand atop a spiral stair
An oracle confronts me there
He leads me on light years away
Through astral nights, galactic days
I see the works of gifted hands
That grace this strange and wondrous land
I see the hand of man arise
With hungry mind and open eyes

[Verse 3]
They left our planets long ago
The elder race still learn and grow
Their power grows with purpose strong
To claim the home where they belong
Home to tear the Temples down...
Home to change!

[Verse 1]
The sleep is still in my eyes
The dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile
And lie awhile in bed
I wish that it might come to pass
Not fade like all my dreams

[Verse 2]
Just think of what my life might be
In a world like I have seen!
I don't think I can carry on
Carry on this cold and empty life
Oh no!

[Guitar Solo]

My spirits are low in the depths of despair
My lifeblood... spills over
