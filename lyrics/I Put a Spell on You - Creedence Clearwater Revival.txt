[Verse 1]
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You better stop
The things that you're doing
I said "watch out!
I ain't lying, yeah!
I ain't gonna take none of your
Fooling around
I ain't gonna take none of your
Putting me down
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine

All right!

[Verse 2]
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You better stop
The things that you're doing
I said "watch out!
I ain't lying, yeah!
I ain't gonna take none of your
Fooling around
I ain't gonna take none of your
Putting me down
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine

All right and I took it down!
