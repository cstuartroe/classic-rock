[Verse 1]
Big black train comin' down the track
Blow your whistle long and long
One minute you're here
Next minute you're gone

[Verse 2]
I lay my penny down on the rails
As the summer wind sings its last song
One minute you're here
Next minute you're gone

[Bridge]
Baby baby baby
I'm so alone
Baby baby baby
I'm coming home

[Verse 3]
Autumn carnival on the edge of town
We walk down the midway arm-in-arm
One minute you're here
Next minute you're gone

[Verse 4]
I thought I knew just who I was
And what I'd do but I was wrong
One minutе you're here
Nеxt minute you're gone

[Bridge]
Red river running along the edge of town
On the muddy banks
I lay my body down
This body down

[Verse 5]
Footsteps cracklin' on a gravel road
Stars vanish in a sky as black as stone
One minute you're here
Next minute you're gone
One minute you're here
Next minute you're gone
One minute you're here
