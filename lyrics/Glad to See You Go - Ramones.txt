[Verse 1]
Going to take a chance on her, one bullet in the cylinder
And in a moment of passion get the glory like Charles Manson
Going to smile, I'm gonna laugh, you're going to get a blood bath
And in a moment of passion get the glory like Charles Manson

[Chorus]
Got to go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye

Now I know the score, I don't need you anymore
Don't want you cause you're a bore

[Verse 2]
I need somebody good, I need a miracle
Should I take a chance on her? One bullet in the cylinder
Going to smile, I'm going to laugh they're going to want my autograph
And in a moment of passion get the glory like Charles Manson

[Chorus]
Got to go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye

Now I know the score, I don't need you anymore
Don't want you cause you're a bore
