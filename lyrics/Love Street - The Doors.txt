[Chorus]
She lives on Love Street
Lingers long on Love Street
She has a house and garden
I would like to see what happens

[Verse 1]
She has robes and she has monkeys
Lazy diamond studded flunkies
She has wisdom and knows what to do
She has me and she has you

[Piano Solo]

[Bridge]
She has wisdom and knows what to do
She has me and she has you

[Verse 2]
I see you live on Love Street
There's this store where the creatures meet
I wonder what they do in there
Summer Sunday and a year
I guess I like it fine, so far

[Chorus]
She lives on Love Street
Lingers long on Love Street
She has a house and garden
I would like to see what happens

[Outro]
La la, la, la-la-la-la
La la, la, la-la-la-la
La la, la, la-la-la-la
La la, la, la-la-la-la...
