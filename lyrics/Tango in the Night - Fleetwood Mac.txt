[Verse 1]
Listen to the wind on the water
Listen to the waves upon the shore
Try to sleep, sleep won't come
Just as I begin to fade

[Chorus]
Then I remember
When the moon was full and bright
I would take you in the darkness
And do the tango in the night
Tango

[Verse 2]
I keep the dream in my pocket
Never let it fade away
Inside, outside
No loneliness in this dream

[Chorus]
Then I remember
When the moon was full and bright
I would take you in the darkness
And do the tango in the night
Tango
