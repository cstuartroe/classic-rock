Day after day, I'm more confused
Yet I look for the light through the pourin' rain
You know that's a game that I hate to loose
And I'm feelin' the strain, ain't it a shame

Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n' roll and drift away
Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n' roll and drift away

Beginnin' to think that I'm wastin' time
I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
Now I'm countin' on you to carry me through

Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n' roll and drift away
Yeah, give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n' roll and drift away

And when my mind is free
You know a melody can move me
And when I'm feelin' blue
The guitar's comin' through to soothe me

Thanks for the joy that you've given me
I want you to know I believe in your song
And rhythm and rhyme and harmony
You help me along makin' me strong

Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n' roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n' roll and drift away

Oh-ho, ah-no
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll
And drift away

Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll
And drift away

Na, na, now won't ya
Won't ya take me
Oh-ha, take me
