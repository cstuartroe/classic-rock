[Verse 1]
Waiting for the winds of change to sweep the clouds away
Waiting for the rainbow's end to cast its gold your way
Countless ways you pass the days

[Verse 2]
Waiting for someone to call and turn your world around
Looking for an answer to the question you have found
Looking for an open door

[Chorus]
You don't get something for nothing
You can't have freedom for free
You won't get wise with the sleep still in your eyes
No matter what your dreams might be

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You don't get something for nothing
You can't have freedom for free
You won't get wise with the sleep still in your eyes
No matter what your dreams might be

[Bridge]
What you own is your own kingdom
What you do is your own glory
What you love is your own power
What you live is your own story

[Verse 3]
In your head is the answer
Let it guide you along
Let your heart be the anchor
And the beat of your own song

[Outro Chorus]
You don't get something for nothing
You can't have freedom for free, no!
You don't get something for nothing
You can't have freedom for free
