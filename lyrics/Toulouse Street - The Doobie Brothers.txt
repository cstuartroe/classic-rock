[Verse 1]
I'm walkin' in shadows, I cannot see
Faces, they smile when I fall or flee
Doors without windows all shuttered tight again

[Chorus]
I just might pass this way again
I just might pass this way again
I just might pass this way
I just might pass this way again

[Verse 2]
The night she is hot, Creole girls they sing
My heart, it is pounding, my ears they ring
The spell has been cast down in New Orleans again

[Chorus]
I just might pass this way again
I just might pass this way again
I just might pass this way
I just might pass this way again

[Bridge]
Locked in a room down in New Orleans
My blood is a-flowin' fast
Locked in a room down in New Orleans
My blood is a-flowin' fast

[Verse 2]
The night she is hot, Creole girls they sing
My heart, it is pounding, my ears they ring
The spell has been cast down in New Orleans again

[Chorus]
I just might pass this way again
I just might pass this way again
I just might pass this way
I just might pass this way again
