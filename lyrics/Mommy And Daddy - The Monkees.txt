Ask your mommy and daddy, "What happened to the Indian?
How come they're all living in places
With too much snow or too much sand?"
Tell your mommy, "I got a funny feeling deep inside of me"
Ask your daddy, "Is it really as bad as people make it seem?"

Wa ta tick it ta too too..

Ask your mommy why everybody swallows all those little pills
Ask your daddy why that soldier doesn't care who he kills
After they've put you to sleep and tucked you safely down in your bed
Whisper, "Mommy and Daddy would you rather that
I learned it from my friends, instead?
Do you think I'm to young to know, to see, to feel, or hear
My questions need an answer or a vaccuum will appear"
Don't be surprised if they turn and walk away
And tell your mommy and daddy that you love them anyway
That you love them anyway...
Give them a kiss
Love will set you free
Kings of EMI

Mommy and Daddy (alt.)

Ask your mommy and daddy, "What happened to the Indian?"
Ask your mommy and daddy to tell you where you really came from
Then mommy and daddy will probably quickly turn and walk away
Then ask your mommy and daddy who really killed J.F.K
Wa ta tick it ta too too...

Ask your mommy if she really gets off on all her pills
Ask your Daddy, "Why doesn't that soldier care who he kills?"
After they've put you to sleep and tucked you safely down in your bed
Whisper Mommy and Daddy
"Would it matter if the bullet went through my head?
If it was my blood spilling on the kitchen floor
If it was my blood, mommy, would you care a little more?"
Don't be surprised when they turn and start to cry
And tell your Mommy and Daddy, tell your mommy and daddy
Scream it to your mommy and daddy
They're living in a lie, a lie, a lie
It's all a lie, a lie, a lie
A lie, a lie...
