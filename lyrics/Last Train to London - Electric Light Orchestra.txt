[Verse 1]
It was 9:29
9:29, back street, big city
The sun was going down
There was music all around
It felt so right

[Verse 2]
It was one of those nights
One of those nights when you feel the world stop turning
You were standing there
There was music in the air
I should've been away
But I knew I had to stay

[Chorus]
Last train to London, just heading out
Last train to London, just leaving town
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
Let the music play on down the line tonight

[Verse 3]
It was one of those nights
One of those nights when you feel a fire is burning
Everybody was there
Everybody to share
It was so right

[Verse 4]
There you were on your own
Looking like you were the only one around
I had to be with you
Nothing else that I could do
I should've been away
But I knew I had to stay

[Chorus]
Last train to London, just heading out
Last train to London, just leaving town
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
Let the music play on down the line tonight

[Verse 5]
Underneath a starry sky
Time was still, but hours must really have rushed by
I didn't realize
But love was in your eyes
I really should've gone
But love went on and on

[Chorus]
Last train to London, just heading out
Last train to London, just leaving town
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
Let the music play on down the line tonight

[Outro]
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
Let the music play on down the line tonight
