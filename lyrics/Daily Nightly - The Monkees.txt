[Verse 1]
Darkened rolling figures move
Through prisms of no color
Hand-in-hand, they walk the night
But never know each other
Passioned pastel neon lights
Light up the jeweled traveler
Who, lost in scenes of smoke filled dreams
Find questions, but no answers

[Verse 2]
Startled eyes that sometimes see
Phantasmagoric splendor
Pirouette down palsied paths
With pennies for the vendor
Salvation's yours for just the time
It takes to pay the dancer
And once again such anxious men
Find questions, but no answers

[Bridge]
The night has gone and taken its infractions
While reddened eyes hope there will be a next one

[Verse 3]
Sahara signs look down upon
A world that glitters glibly
And mountain sides put arms around
The unsuspecting city
Second hands that minds have slowed
Are moving even faster
Toward bringing down someone who's found
The questions but no answers
