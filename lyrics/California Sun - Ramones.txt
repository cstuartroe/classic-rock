[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm going out west where I belong
Where the days are short and the nights are long

[Chorus]
And I'll walk and they’ll walk
I'll twist and they’ll twist
And I'll shimmy and they’ll shimmy
And I'll fly and they’ll fly
Yeah, we're out there having fun
In the warm California sun

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm going out west down on the coast
Where the California girls are really the most

[Chorus]
And I'll walk and they'll walk
I'll twist and they'll twist
And I'll shimmy and they'll shimmy
And I'll fly and they'll fly
Well we're out there having fun
In the warm California sun

[Verse 3]
Well, the girls are frisky in old ‘Frisco
A pretty little chick wherever you go

[Chorus]
Oh, and I walk and they walk
I twist and they twist
And I shimmy and they shimmy
And I fly and they'll fly
Where we're out there having fun
In the warm California sun
We're out there having fun
In the warm California sun
