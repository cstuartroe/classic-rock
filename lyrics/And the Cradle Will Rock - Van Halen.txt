[Verse 1]
Well, they say it's kinda fright'nin' how this younger generation swings
You know, it's more than just some new sensation
Well, the kid is into losin' sleep and he don't come home for half the week
You know, it's more than just an aggravation

[Chorus]
And the cradle will rock
Yes, the cradle will rock
And I say, rock on!
Rock on!

[Verse 2]
And when some local kid gets down, they try and drum him out of town
They say, "You coulda least faked it, boy."
At an early age he hits the street and winds up tied with who he meets, and he's unemployed

[Chorus]
And the cradle will rock
Yeah, the cradle will rock
And I say, rock on!
Rock on!
Have you seen Junior's grades?

[Verse 3]
And when some local kid gets down, they try and drum him out of town
They say, "You coulda least faked it, boy."
Faked it, boy
At an early age he hits the street and winds up tied with who he meets, and he's unemployed
His folks are overjoyed

[Chorus]
And the cradle will rock
Yeah, the cradle will rock
And I say, rock on!
Rock on!
Rock on!
Rock on!
