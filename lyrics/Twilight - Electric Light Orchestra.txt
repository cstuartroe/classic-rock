[Verse 1]
The visions dancing in my mind
The early dawn, the shades of time
Twilight crawling through my windowpane
Am I awake or do I dream
The strangest pictures I have seen
Night is day, and twilight's gone away

[Pre-Chorus]
(With your head held high
And your scarlet lies
You came down to me
From the open skies)
It's either real or it's a dream
There's nothing that is in between

[Chorus]
(Twilight) I only meant to stay awhile
Twilight, I'll give you time
To steal my mind away from me

[Verse 2]
Across the night, I saw your face
You disappeared without a trace
You brought me here
But can you take me back
In sight, the image of your light
That now is day and once was night
You lead me here, and then you go away

[Pre-Chorus]
It's either real or it's a dream
There's nothing that is in between

[Chorus]
(Twilight)
(Twilight) I'll give you time
To steal my mind away from me

[Bridge]
You brought me here
But can you take me back again

[Pre-Chorus]
(With your head held high
And your scarlet lies
You came down to me
From the open skies)
It's either real or it's a dream
There's nothing that is in between

[Chorus]
(Twilight) I only meant to stay awhile
(Twilight) I'll give you time
To steal my mind

[Outro]
(Twilight) I only meant to stay awhile
(Twilight) I only meant to stay awhile
Twilight, (twilight) twilight, (twilight)
