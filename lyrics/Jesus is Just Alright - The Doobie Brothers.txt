[Chorus]
Jesus is just alright with me
Jesus is just alright, oh yeah
Jesus is just alright with me
Jesus is just alright

[Verse 1]
I don't care what they may say
I don't care what they may do
I don't care what they may say
Jesus is just alright, oh yeah
Jesus is just alright

[Chorus]
Jesus is just alright with me
Jesus is just alright, oh yeah
Jesus is just alright with me
Jesus is just alright

[Verse 2]
I don't care what they may know
I don't care where they may go
I don't care what they may know
Jesus is just alright, oh yeah

[Bridge]
Jesus, He's my friend
Jesus, He's my friend
He took me by the hand
And led me far from this land
Jesus, He's my friend

[Chorus]
Jesus is just alright with me
Jesus is just alright, oh yeah
Jesus is just alright with me
Jesus is just alright

[Verse 1]
I don't care what they may say
I don't care what they may do
I don't care what they may say
Jesus is just alright, oh yeah
