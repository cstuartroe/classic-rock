[Verse 1]
Traffic in the city turns my head around
No, no, no, no, no
Backed up on the freeway
Backed up in the church
Everywhere you look there's a frown, frown

[Chorus]
Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone
Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone

[Verse 2]
People keep a talking they don't say a word
Jaw, jaw, jaw, jaw, jaw
Talk up in the White House, talk up to your door
So much going on I just can't hear

[Chorus]
Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone
Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone

[Verse 3]
Hurrying to get there so you save some time
Run, run, run, run, run
Rushing to the treadmill, rushing to get home
Worry 'bout the time you save, save

[Chorus]
Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone
Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone
Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone
