[Verse 1]
Is it you again outside
Just banging on the front door?
You say you had enough
Now you're coming back for more

[Chorus]
But that's alright
I said that, "That's alright"
I may not want to admit it
I'm just a fool for your stockings, I believe

[Verse 2]
Now, I don't mind when you send money
And bring your girlfriends with you
But how could one be so thoughtless to try
And handle less than two?

[Chorus]
But that's alright
I said that, "That's alright baby"
I may not want to admit it
I'm just a fool for your stocking
I believe, yeah

[Instrumental break 1:39-2:59]

[Verse 3]
Now, I'm telling everybody
It seems too good to be true
Sweet things can always get sweeter
I know mine did, how about you?

[Chorus]
Yes, it's alright
I said yes it, yes it is, "That's alright"
I may not want to admit it
I'm just a fool for your stockings, I believe

[Instrumental outro 3:32-4:16]
