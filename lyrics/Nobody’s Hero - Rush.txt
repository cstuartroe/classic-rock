[Verse 1]
I knew he was different in his sexuality
I went to his parties as a straight minority
It never seemed a threat to my masculinity
He only introduced me to a wider reality

[Per-Chorus]
As the years went by, we drifted apart
When I heard that he was gone
I felt a shadow cross my heart

[Chorus 1]
But he's nobody's hero
Saves a drowning child
Cures a wasting disease
Hero...lands the crippled airplane
Solves great mysteries
Hero...not the handsome actor
Who plays a hero's role
Hero...not the glamour girl
Who'd love to sell her soul
If anybody's buying
Nobody's hero

[Verse 2]
I didn't know the girl, but I knew her family
All their lives were shattered in a nightmare of brutality
They try to carry on, try to bear the agony
Try to hold some faith in the goodness of humanity

[Pre-Chorus]
As the years went by, we drifted apart
When I heard that she was gone
I felt a shadow cross my heart

[Chorus 2]
But she's nobody's hero
Is the voice of reason against the howling mob
Hero...is the pride of purpose
In the unrewarding job
Hero...not the champion player
Who plays the perfect game
Hero...not the glamour boy
Who loves to sell his name
Everybody's buying
Nobody's hero

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
As the years went by, we drifted apart
When I heard that you were gone
I felt a shadow cross my heart

[Chorus 3]
But he's nobody's hero
Saves a drowning child
Cures a wasting disease
Hero...lands the crippled airplane
Solves great mysteries
Hero...not the handsome actor
Who plays a hero's role
Hero...not the glamour girl
Who'd love to sell her soul
If anybody's buying
Nobody's hero

[Outro]
Hero!
