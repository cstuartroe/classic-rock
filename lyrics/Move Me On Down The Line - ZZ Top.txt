[Verse 1]
When I hear that Santa Fe start blowing
I wonder where it's been
And where it's going

[Chorus]
I tell you boy, every time
The feelin' sure is fine
Just move me on down the line
Just move me on down the line

[Verse 2]
Then I heard that rooster start his crowing
Around the curve that cloud
Of smoke was blowing

[Chorus]
I tell you boy, every time
The feelin' sure is fine
Just move me on down the line
Just move me on down the line

[Instrumental break 1:04-1:46]

[Verse 3]
I'll be where the big wheels keep on turnin'
And the diesel drivers
Keep them engines burnin'

[Chorus]
I tell you boy, every time
The feelin' sure is fine
Just move me on down the line
Just move me on down the line

[Outro]
Move me on down the line
Move me on down
Move me on down the line
Move me on down
Move me on down the line
Move me on down
Move me on down the line
Move me on down
Move me on down the line
Move me on down
