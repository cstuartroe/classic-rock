[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Get loose

[Verse 1]
I live, uptown
I live, downtown
I live, all around

[Pre-Chorus]
I had money, and I had none
I had money, and I had none
But I never been so broke that I couldn't leave, town

[Chorus]
I'm a Changeling
See me change
I'm a Changeling
See me change
I'm the air you breathe
Food you eat
Friends your greet
In the sullen street, wow
See me change, see me change, get loose

[Verse 1 Reprise]
I live, uptown
I live, downtown
I live, all around

[Pre-Chorus]
I had money, yeah, and I had none
I had money, yeah, and I had none
But I never been so broke that I couldn't leave, town

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Well, I'm the air you breathe
Food you eat
Friends your greet
In the sullen street, wow

[Outro]
You gotta see me change
See me change
Yeah, I'm leaving town
On a midnight train
Gotta see me change
Change, change, change
Change, change, change
Change, change, change
Change, change, change
Woah, change, change, change
