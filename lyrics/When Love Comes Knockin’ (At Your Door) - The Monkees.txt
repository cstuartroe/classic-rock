When love comes knockin' at your door
Just open up and let 'im in
It's gonna be a magic carpet ride;
So little girl now don't you run and hide

I know that you've been hurt before
But don't you be afraid no more
Throw off the chains that bind
And leave the past behind;
When love comes knocking at your door

When love comes knocking at your door
Just open up and let 'im in
It's gonna be a magic carpet ride;
So little girl now don't you run and hide
You'll see a rainbow ev'ry day
The sun will shine in ev'ry way
Throw off the chains that bind
And leave the past behind;
No need to worry anymore
When love comes knocking at your door
At your door
At your door
At your door
Ah
