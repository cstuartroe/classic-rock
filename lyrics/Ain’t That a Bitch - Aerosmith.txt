[Verse 1]
Up in smoke you've lost another lover
As you take your hit off your last cigarette, yeah
Strung out, burn out
Yeah you're down on your luck
And you don't give a huh
Until the best part of you starts to twitch
Ain't that a bitch

[Chorus]
Freak out! I'm alone now
I feel just like I'm losin' my mind
Because love is like the right dress
On the wrong girl
You never know what you're gonna find
You think you're high and fine as wine
Then you wind up like a dog in a ditch
Because love is like a wrong turn
On a cold night, yeah
Ain't that a bitch, yeah
Ain't that a bitch, yeah yeah...

[Verse 2]
In a daze
In the throes of emotion
You see God in the Devil's eyes
Then you fall so far from grace
You wouldn't know a kiss
If it was on your face
You can tell it to the jury
But you ain't got no case

[Chorus]
Freak out! I'm alone now
I feel just like I'm losin' my mind
Because love is like the right dress
On the wrong girl
You never know what you're gonna find
The gal was fine as calamine but not
Enough to scratch a seven year itch
'Cause love is like the last licks
Outta Hendrix, yeah
Ain't that a bitch, yeah
Ain't that a bitch

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Then you feel so out of place
Lickin' up the arsenic
From the same old lace
You know the stuff is poison
But you got to have a taste
You got to

[Chorus]
Freak out! I'm alone now
I feel just like I'm losin' my mind
Because love is like the right dress
On the wrong girl
You never know what you're gonna find
You think you're high and fine as wine
Then you wind up with your face in a ditch
Because love is like a warm gun
On a cold night, yeah
Ain't that a bitch, yeah
Ain't that a bitch, yeah

[Tyler scat sings]
Ain't that a bitch
