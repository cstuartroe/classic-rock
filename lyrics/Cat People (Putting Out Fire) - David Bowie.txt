[Verse 1]
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
It's been so long

[Verse 2]
Feel my blood enraged
It's just the fear of losing you
Don't you know my name?
And you've been so long

[Chorus]
And I've been putting out fire
With gasoline

[Verse 3]
See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long

[Verse 4]
Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through
You've been so long
And it's been so long

[Chorus]
And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out the fire
With gasoline

[Verse 5]
See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
These tears can never dry
A judgement made can never bend
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been throughâ€‹
You've been so long
Well, it's been so long

[Chorus]
And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out fire
With gasoline

[Outro]
(Been so long)
(Been so long) and it's been so long
(Been so long) I've been putting out fire
(Been so long) it's been so long
(Been so long) been putting out fire
(Been so long) it's been so long
(Been so long) putting out fire
(Been so long)
Been so long (so long, so long)
Been so long (so long, so long)
Been putting out fire (been so long, so long, so long)
Been putting out fire (been so long, so long, so long)
Been so long
(Been so long, so long, so long)
(Been so long, so long so long)
Been putting out fire
Been putting out fire
Been so long
Been so long
And I've been putting out fire
I've been putting out fire
