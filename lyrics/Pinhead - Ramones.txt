[Intro]
Gabba gabba, we accept you, we accept you, one of us
Gabba gabba, we accept you, we accept you, one of us

[Chorus 1]
I don't want to be a pinhead no more
I just met a nurse that I could go for
I don't want to be a pinhead no more
I just met a nurse that I could go for
I don't want to be a pinhead no more
I just met a nurse that I could go for
I don't want to be a pinhead no more
I just met a nurse that I could go for

[Chorus 2]
D-U-M-B
Everyone's accusing me
D-U-M-B
Everyone's accusing me

[Chorus 1]
I don't want to be a pinhead no more
I just met a nurse that I could go for
I don't want to be a pinhead no more
I just met a nurse that I could go for

[Outro]
Gabba gabba hey!
