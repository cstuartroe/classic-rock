[Intro]
All right

[Chorus]
Wild child full of grace
Savior of the human race
Your cool face

[Bridge]
Natural child, terrible child
Not your mother's or your father's child
Your our child, screaming wild
An ancient lunatic reins
In the trees of the night
Ha, ha, ha, ha

[Verse]
With hunger at her heels
Freedom in her eyes
She dances on her knees
Pirate prince at her side
Staring into the hollow idolâ€™s eye

[Chorus]
Wild child full of grace
Savior of the human race
Your cool face[x3]

[Outro]
Do you remember when we were in Africa?
