[Verse 1]
Contact is all it takes
To change your life to lose your place in time
Contact! Asleep or awake
Coming around you may wake up to find
Questions deep within your eyes
Now more than ever, you realize

[Chorus]
And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
Then simply pulls a string

[Verse 2]
Another world, some other time
You lay your sanity on the line
Familiar faces familiar sights
Reach back, remember with all your might
Ooh, there she stands in a silken gown
Silver lights shining down

[Chorus]
And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
Then simply pulls a string
Love comes walkin' in

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Ah, sleep and dream, that's all I crave
I travel far across the Milky Way
To my master I become a slave
Til we meet again some other day
Where silence speaks as loud as war
Earth returns to what it was before

[Chorus]
And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
Then simply pulls a string
Love comes walkin' in

[Guitar Solo/Outro]
