I used to be on an endless run
Believe in miracles 'cause I'm one
I have been blessed with the power to survive
After all these years I'm still alive
I'm out here kicking with the band
I am no longer a solitary man
Every day my time runs out
Lived like a fool, that's what I was about, oh

I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you
I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you

Tattooed your name on my arm
I always said my girl's a good luck charm
If she can find a reason to forgive
Then I can find a reason to live
I used to be on an endless run
Believe in miracles 'cause I'm one
I have been blessed with the power to survive
After all these years I'm still alive

I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you
I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you

I close my eyes and think how it might be
The future's here today
It's not too late
It's not too late, yeah!

I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you
I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you oh yeah
