[Intro]

We're all in the dream
The dream of life

[Verse 1]
Hey, Boy Blue, can't you hear all the noise?
It's for you, all the town's waiting there
Let us go, there's a show like you ain't seen before
Welcome home, where you been all these years?
Look around, all the crowd is in tears
It's so good to see you in the streets of your town

[Chorus]
Hey, Boy Blue is back
Hey, Boy Blue is back
Hey, Boy Blue is back

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Hey, Boy Blue is back
Hey, Boy Blue is back
Hey, Boy Blue is back

[Verse 2]
I've seen bold knights dropping down like flies
I've seen kings rolling in the mire
I've seen God point the finger of doom to our foes
I have fought in the holiest wars
I have smashed some of the holiest jaws
I've been jailed, been impaled and been dragged through the world

[Verse 3]
One thing I have learned through these years
Is that no man should be stricken with fear
It should be that he walks with no care in the world
So my friends, who are gathered today
Hear this clear, for I'll not further say
That no man shall cause me to take up arms again

[Chorus]
Hey, Boy Blue is back
Hey, Boy Blue is back
Hey, Boy Blue is back
Hey, Boy Blue is back
Hey, Boy Blue is back
Hey, Boy Blue is back
