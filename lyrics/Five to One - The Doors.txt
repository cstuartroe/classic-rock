[Intro]
Yeah, c'mon
I love my girl
She lookin' good
C'mon
One more

[Verse 1]
Five to one, baby
One in five
No one here gets out alive, now
You get yours, baby
I'll get mine
Gonna make it, baby
If we try

[Verse 2]
The old get old
And the young get stronger
May take a week
And it may take longer
They got the guns
But we got the numbers
Gonna win, yeah
We're takin' over
Come on!

[Verse 3]
Your ballroom days are over, baby
Night is drawing near
Shadows of the evening
Crawl across the years

Ya walk across the floor with a flower in your hand
Trying to tell me no one understands
Trade in your hours for a handful of dimes
Gonna' make it, baby, in our prime

[Chorus]
Come together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together, aha
Get together one more time!
Get together one more time!
Get together one more time!
Get together one more time!
Get together one more time!
Get together, got to, get together

Ooaaaaaah!

[Bridge]
Hey, c'mon, honey
You won't have a long wait for me, baby
I'll be there in just a little while
You see, I gotta go out in this car with these people and...

[Outro]
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together, got to
Get together, got to
Get together, got to
Take you up in my room and
Hah-hah-hah-hah-hah
Love my girl
She looking good, looking real good
Love you, come on
