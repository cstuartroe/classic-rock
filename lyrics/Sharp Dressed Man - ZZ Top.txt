[Verse 1]
Clean shirt, new shoes
And I don't know where I am goin' to
Silk suit, black tie (black tie)
I don't need a reason why

[Chorus]
They come runnin'
Just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy
About a sharp dressed man

[Verse 2]
Gold watch, diamond ring
I ain't missin' not a single thing
Cufflinks, stick pin
When I step out
I'm gonna do you in

[Chorus]
They come runnin'
Just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy
About a sharp dressed man

[Instrumental break 1:17-2:26]
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Top coat, top hat
And not to worry cause my wallet's fat
Black shades, white gloves
Lookin' sharp, lookin' for love

[Chorus]
They come runnin'
Just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl's crazy
About a sharp dressed man
That's right, real fine

[Instrumental outro 2:54-4:18]
