[Verse 1]
Was riding alongside the highway
Rolling up the countryside
Thinking I'm the devil's heat wave
What you burn in your crazy mind
Saw a slight distraction standing by the road
She was smiling there, yellow in her hair
Do you want to, I was thinking, would you care

[Chorus]
Sweet hitch-a-hiker
We could make music at the Greasy King
Sweet hitch-a-hiker
Won't you ride on my fast machine?

[Verse 2]
Cruising on through the junction
I'm flying about the speed of sound
Noticing peculiar function
I'm no roller coaster show me down
I turned away to see her
Whoa! she caught my eye
But I was rolling down, moving too fast
Do you want to, she was thinking, can it last

[Chorus]
Sweet hitch-a-hiker
We could make music at the Greasy King
Sweet hitch-a-hiker
Won't you ride on my fast machine?

[Verse 3]
Was busted up along the highway
I'm the saddest riding fool alive
Wondering if you're goin' my way
Won't you give a poor boy a ride?
Now here she comes a-riding
Lord, she's flying high
She was rolling down, moving too fast
Do you want to, she was thinking, can I last

[Chorus]
Sweet hitch-a-hiker
We could make music at the Greasy King
Sweet hitch-a-hiker
Won't you ride on my fast machine?

[Chorus]
Sweet hitch-a-hiker
We could make music at the Greasy King
Sweet hitch-a-hiker
Won't you ride on my fast machine?

[Chorus]
Sweet hitch-a-hiker
We could make music at the Greasy King
Sweet hitch-a-hiker
Won't you ride on my fast machine?

[Outro]
Sweet hitch-a-hiker
We could make music at the Greasy King
