[Verse 1]
Well no one ever thought this one would survive
Helpless child, going to walk a drum beat behind
I lock you in a dream, I never let you go
I never let you laugh or smile, not you

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I just want to walk right out of this world
''Cause everybody has a poison heart
I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart

[Verse 2]
Making friends with a homeless torn up man
He just kind of smiles, it really shakes me up
There's danger on every corner but I'm okay
Walking down the street, trying to forget yesterday

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart

[Chorus]
A poison heart
A poison heart
A poison heart, yeah

[Verse 3]
You know that life really takes its toll
And a poet's gut reaction is to search his very soul
So much their confusion before my eyes
But nothing seems to phase me, and this one still survives

[Pre-Chorus]
I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
Well I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart

[Chorus]
A poison heart
A poison heart
A poison heart
A poison heart
A poison heart
A poison heart
A poison heart
