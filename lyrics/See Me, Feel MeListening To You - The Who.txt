VOICES:
Listening to you I get the music
Gazing at you I get the heat
Following you I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet

Right behind you I see the millions
On you I see the glory
From you I get opinions
From you I get the story

Listening to you I get the music
Gazing at you I get the heat
Following you I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet

Gazing at you I get the heat (heat)
Following you I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet

Right behind you I see the millions
On you, oh I see the glory

Ohh, listening to you I get the music
Gazing at you I get the heat
