[Verse 1]
I've been searching
For a pot of gold
Like the kind you find
At the end of the rainbow
I've been dreaming
I thought it was in vain
Ah but now you're here
Can't believe that you're back again

[Chorus 1]
Now I know I can't lose
As long as you follow
I'm going to win
(I'm going to win)
I'm going to beg, steal, or borrow
As long as you follow

[Verse 2]
I've been wandering
Gone away too far
But the road was rough
To get back where you are
And the sun went down
It never seemed to rise
Ah but now you're here
With the light shining in your eyes

[Chorus 1][x2]

[Chorus 2][x2]
(As long as you follow)
As long as you follow
(As long as you follow)
As long as you follow
