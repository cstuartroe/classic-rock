[Verse]
I hold you in my arms as the band plays
What are those words whispered, baby, just as you turn away
I saw you last night out on the edge of town
I wanna read your mind to know just what I've got in this new thing I've found

[Chorus]
So tell me what I see when I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby, or just a brilliant disguise?

[Verse 2]
I heard somebody call your name from underneath our willow
I saw something tucked in shame underneath your pillow
Well I've tried so hard, baby, but I just can't see
What a woman like you is doing with me

[Chorus]
So tell me who I see when I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby, or just a brilliant disguise?

[Bridge]
Now look at me, baby
Struggling to do everything right
And then it all falls apart
When out go the lights
I'm just a lonely pilgrim
I walk this world in wealth
I want to know if it's you I don't trust
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself

[Verse 3]
Now you play the loving woman, I'll play the faithful man
But just don't look too close into the palm of my hand
We stood at the altar, the gypsy swore our future was right
But come the wee wee hours, well maybe, baby, the gypsy lied

[Chorus]
So when you look at me, you better look hard and look twice
Is that me, baby, or just a brilliant disguise?

[Verse 4]
Tonight our bed is cold
I'm lost in the darkness of our love
God have mercy on the man
Who doubts what he's sure of
