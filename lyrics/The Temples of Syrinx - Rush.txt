[VERSE 1]
We've taken care of everything
The words you hear, the songs you sing
The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes

It's one for all and all for one
We work together, common sons
Never need to wonder how or why

[Chorus]
We are the priests of the temples of Syrinx
Our great computers fill the hallowed halls

We are the priests of the temples of Syrinx
All the gifts of life are held within our walls

[VERSE 2]
Look around at this world we've made
Equality our stock in trade
Come and join the brotherhood of man

Oh what a nice, contented world
Let the banners be unfurled
Hold the red star proudly high in hand

[Chorus]
We are the priests of the temples of Syrinx
Our great computers fill the hallowed halls

We are the priests of the temples of Syrinx
All the gifts of life are held within our walls
