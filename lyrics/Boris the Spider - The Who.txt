[Verse 1]
Look, he's crawling up my wall
Black and hairy, very small
Now he's up above my head
Hanging by a little thread

[Hook]
Boris the spider
Boris the spider

[Verse 2]
Now he's dropped on to the floor
Heading for the bedroom door
Maybe he's as scared as me
Where's he gone now, I can't see

[Hook]
Boris the spider
Boris the spider

[Chorus]
Creepy, crawly, creepy, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly

[Verse 3]
There he is wrapped in a ball
Doesn't seem to move at all
Perhaps he's dead, I'll just make sure
Pick this book up off the floor

[Hook]
Boris the spider
Boris the spider

[Chorus]
Creepy, crawly, creepy, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly

[Verse 4]
He's come to a sticky end
Don't think he will ever mend
Never more will he crawl 'round
He's embedded in the ground

[Hook]
Boris the spider
Boris the spider
