I'll love you this year, I'll love you next year, and then forever
I'll always need you, I'll never leave you, I'll love you forever
And if you ever change your mind, think again, and give me time
You're my first love, you are my last love, you're my forever

I love this feeling, my heart is beating a mile a minute
No other woman has ever been so deep inside in it
And when the sun shines on our love, that's when I thank the Lord above
You're my first love, you are my last love, you're my beginning

And when the sun shines on our love, that's when I thank the Lord above
You're my first love, you are my last love, you are my everlasting love
You are my first love, you are my last love, you're my forever
