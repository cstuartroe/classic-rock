[Intro]

[Verse 1]
At night I walk this stinkin' street
Past the crazies on my block
And I see the same old faces
And I hear that same old talk
And I'm searching for the latest thing
A break in this routine
I'm talkin' some new kicks
Ones like you ain't never seen

[Chorus 1]
This is home
This is Mean Street
It's our home
The only one I know

[Verse 2]
And we don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Cause we're sick of these four walls
Now what'd ya think is nothing
Might be something after all
Now you know this ain't no through street
The end is dead ahead
The poor folks play for keeps down here
They're the living dead

[Chorus 2]
Come on down
Down to Mean Street
They're dancing now
Out on Mean Street

[Guitar Solo]
Dance, baby!

[Verse 3]
It's always here and now, my friend
It ain't 'once upon a time'
It's all over but the shouting
I've come to take what's mine
We're searching for the latest thing
A break in this routine
Talkin' some new kicks
Ones like you ain't never seen

[Refrain]
This is home
This is Mean Street
It's our home
Only one I know

[Outro]
(This is home)
See, a gun is real easy
(This is Mean Street)
In this desperate part of town
(This is home)
Turns you from hunted into hunter
(This is Mean Street)
You go and hunt somebody down
But hear me now
(This is home)
Somebody said, "Fair Warning, Lord!
(This is Mean Street)
Lord, strike that poor boy down!"
