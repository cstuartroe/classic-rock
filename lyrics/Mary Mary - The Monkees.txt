[Verse 1]
Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?
Mary, Mary, can I go too
This one thing I will vow ya
I'd rather die than to live without ya

[Verse 2]
Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?
Mary, Mary, tell me truly
What did I do to make you leave me?
Whatever it was I didn't mean to
You know I never would try and hurt ya
Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?

[Bridge]
What more, Mary, can I do
To prove my love is truly yours?
I've done more now than a clear-thinkin' man would do

[Verse 3]
Mary, Mary, it's not over
Where you go, I will follow
'Til I win your love again
And walk beside you, but until then
Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?

[Outro]
Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?
Mary, where you goin' to?
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?
Aw, Mary, where you goin' to?
Mary, Mary
Mary, where you goin' to?
