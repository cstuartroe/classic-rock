[Verse 1]
Girl, I know the grass is greener just around the bend
Gotta say goodbye, but don't you fear
Though the road is broken I might fail to find the end
I won't disappear

[Chorus]
I'll get back up on my feet
I'll get back up on my feet
Chase the moon and sun to find my one and only you
I'll get back up on my feet
I'll get back up on my feet
Lookin' high and I'm lookin' low
When I find my boots, I know I gotta go

[Verse 2]
Maybe I will be a star, or maybe just a clown
Girl, I'll never know until I try
Maybe I will meet a girl who'll try to keep me down
But you don't have to cry

[Chorus]
I'll get back up on my feet
I'll get back up on my feet
Chase the moon and sun to find my one and only you
I'll get back up on my feet
I'll get back up on my feet
Lookin' high and I'm lookin' low
When I find my boots, I know I gotta go

[Verse 2, condensed]
Maybe I will meet a girl who'll try to keep me down
But you don't have to cry

[Chorus]
I'll get back up on my feet
I'll get back up on my feet
Chase the moon and sun to find my one and only you
I'll get back up on my feet
I'll get back up on my feet
Lookin' high and I'm lookin' low
When I find my boots, I know I gotta go
When I find my boots, I know I gotta go
When I find my boots, I know I gotta go
