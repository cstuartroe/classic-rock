[Verse 1]
Who needs remote control
From the Civic Hall
Push a button
Activate
You got to work
You're late

[Verse 2]
It's so grey in London town
With a Panda car crawlin' around
Here it comes
Eleven o'clock
Where can we go now?

[Chorus]
Can't make a noise
Can't get no gear
Can't make no money
Can't get outta here

[Verse 3]
Big business it don't like you
It don't like the things ya' do
They got no money
They got no power
They think you're useless
An' so you are, punk!

[Verse 4]
They had a meeting in Mayfair
They got ya' down and they want to keep you there
It makes them worried
Their bank accounts
That's all that matters
You don't count

[Chorus]
Can't make no progress
Can't get ahead
Can't stop the regress
Don't wanna be dead

(Look out those rules and regulations)

[Verse 5]
Who needs the Parliament
Sittin' makin' laws all day
They're all fat and old
Queuin' for the House of Lords
Repression (gonna start on Tuesday)
Repression (gonna be a Dalek)
Repression (I am a robot)
Repression (I obey)
