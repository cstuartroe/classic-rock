[Verse 1]
My eyes have seen you...
My eyes have seen you...
My eyes have seen you stand in your door
Meet inside, show me some more
Show me some more
Show me some more

[Verse 2]
My eyes have seen you...
My eyes have seen you...
My eyes have seen you turn and stare
Fix your hair, move upstairs
Move upstairs
Move upstairs

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
My eyes have seen you...
My eyes have seen you...
My eyes have seen you free from disguise
Gazing on a city under television skies!
Television skies!
Television skies!

[Verse 4]
My eyes have seen you...
My eyes have seen you...
Eyes have seen you let them photograph your soul!
Memorize your alleys on an endless roll, endless roll

[Outro]
Endless roll, endless roll...
Endless roll, endless roll...
Endless roll, endless roll...
Endless roll, endless roll...
Endless roll, endless roll...
Endless roll, endless roll...
Endless roll, endless roll...
