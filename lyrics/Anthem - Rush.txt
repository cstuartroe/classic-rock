[Verse 1]
Know your place in life is where you want to be
Don't let them tell you that you owe it all to me
Keep on looking forward, no use in looking 'round
Hold your head above the crowd and they won't bring you down

[Chorus]
Anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind
A funeral dirge for eyes gone blind
We marvel after those who sought
Wonders in the world, wonders in the world
Wonders in the world they wrought!

[Verse 2]
Live for yourself, there's no one else more worth living for
Begging hands and bleeding hearts will only cry out for more

[Chorus]
Anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind
A funeral dirge for eyes gone blind
We marvel after those who sought
Wonders in the world, wonders in the world
Wonders in the world they wrought!

[Instrumental break 2:26-3:22]
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, I know they've always told you selfishness was wrong
Yet it was for me, not you, I came to write this song

[Chorus]
Anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind
A funeral dirge for eyes gone blind
We marvel after those who sought
Wonders in the world, wonders in the world
Wonders in the world they wrought!
Wrought!
Wrought!
