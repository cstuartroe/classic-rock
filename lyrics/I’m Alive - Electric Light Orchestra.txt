[Verse 1]
I'm alive!
And the world shines for me today
I'm alive!
Suddenly I am here today
Seems like forever, and a day
Thought I could never feel this way
Is this really me?
I'm alive, I'm alive

[Verse 2]
I'm alive!
And the dawn breaks across the sky
I'm alive!
And the sun rises up so high
Lost in another world, far away
Never another word till today
But what can I say?
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive

Suddenly came the dawn from the night
Suddenly I was born into light
How can it be real?
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive

[Verse 1]
I'm alive!
And the world shines for me today
I'm alive!
Suddenly I am here today
Seems like forever and a day
Thought I could never feel this way
Is this really me?
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive!

I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive!
