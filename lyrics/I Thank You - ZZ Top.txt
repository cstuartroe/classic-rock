[Chorus]
You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you
You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you

[Verse 1]
Then you took your love to someone else
I wouldn't know what it meant
To be loved to death
You made me feel like I've never felt
Kisses so good I had to holler for help

[Chorus]
You didn't have to squeeze but you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you
You didn't have to hold it but you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you

[Verse 2]
Every day was something new
You put on your bag and you're fine to-do
You got me trying new things too
Just so I can keep up with you

[Chorus]
You didn't have to shake it but you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you
You didn't have to make it like you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you

[Verse 3]
All my life I've been shortchanged
Without your love baby, it's a crying shame
And now I know
What the fellas talkinâ€™ about
When they say that they been turned out

[Bridge]
I want  to thank you
I want to thank you
I want to thank you
Yes, I want to thank you
