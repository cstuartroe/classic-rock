[Verse 1]
You want to race, if you insist
At that price I can't resist
That's right, that's right
That's right

[Verse 2]
Tonight it ain't right
I got to have me a week
But I'll be back for you, Jack
And I'll let the machine speak
That's right, that's right
That's right

[Instrumental break 1:09-1:53]

[Outro]
Showdown, you bet
And I haven't even saddled my pony yet
Have mercy, Miss Percy
I done put the coon tune on this vette
That's right, that's right
That's right
