[Verse 1]
I know that something very strange
Is happened to my brain
I'm either feeling very good
Or else I am insane
The seeds of doubt you planted
Have started to grow wild
And I feel that I must yield
Before the wisdom of a child

[Chorus]
And it's love you bring
No, that I can't deny
And with your wings
I can learn to fly
Sweet young thing (Sweet young thing)

[Verse 2]
People try to talk to me (Sweet young thing)
Their words are ugly sounds
But I resist all their attempts (Sweet young thing)
To try and bring me down
Turned on to the sunset (Sweet young thing)
Like I've never been before
I listen for your footsteps (Sweet young thing)
And your knock upon the door

[Chorus]
And it's love you bring
No, that I can't deny
With your wings
I can learn to fly
Sweet young thing

[Chorus]
And it's love you bring
With dreams of bluer skies
And the morning sings
When I see it in your eyes
Sweet young thing
Sweet young thing
