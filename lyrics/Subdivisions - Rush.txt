[Verse 1]
Sprawling on the fringes of the city
In geometric order
An insulated border
In between the bright lights
And the far unlit unknown

[Verse 2]
Growing up it all seems so one-sided
Opinions all provided
The future pre-decided
Detached and subdivided
In the mass production zone
Nowhere is the dreamer or the misfit so alone

[Chorus: Geddy Lee & Neil Peart]
(Subdivisions) --
In the high school halls
In the shopping malls
Conform or be cast out
(Subdivisions) --
In the basement bars
In the backs of cars
Be cool or be cast out

[Post-Chorus]
Any escape might help to smooth
The unattractive truth
But the suburbs have no charms to soothe
The restless dreams of youth

[Verse 3]
Drawn like moths we drift into the city
The timeless old attraction
Cruising for the action
Lit up like a firefly
Just to feel the living night

[Verse 4]
Some will sell their dreams for small desires
Or lose the race to rats
Get caught in ticking traps
And start to dream of somewhere
To relax their restless flight
Somewhere out of a memory
Of lighted streets on quiet nights

[Chorus: Geddy Lee & Neil Peart]
(Subdivisions) --
Ihe high school halls
In the shopping malls
Conform or be cast out
(Subdivisions) --
Ihe basement bars
In the backs of cars
Be cool or be cast out

[Post-Chorus]
Any escape might help to smooth
The unattractive truth
But the suburbs have no charms to soothe
The restless dreams of youth

[Instrumental Outro]
