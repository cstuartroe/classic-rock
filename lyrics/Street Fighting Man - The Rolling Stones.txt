[Verse 1]
Everywhere I hear the sound of marching, charging feet, boy
'Cause summer's here, and the time is right for fighting in the street, boy
Well, what can a poor boy do except to sing for a rock and roll band?

[Chorus]
'Cause in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man, no

[Verse 2]
Hey! Think the time is right for a palace revolution
'Cause where I live the game to play is compromise solution
Well, then what can a poor boy do except to sing for a rock and roll band?

[Chorus]
'Cause in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man, no

Get down

[Verse 3]
Hey! Said my name is called Disturbance
I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the king, I'll rail at all his servants
Well, then what can a poor boy do except to sing for a rock and roll band?

[Chorus]
Because in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man, no
Get down
