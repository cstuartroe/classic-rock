[Verse 1]
She used to drive a beat up pickup
Down around San Antone
Stealing the heart of every guy in town
Including the one I own
But this sweet young thing of seventeen
Would sting you with the lovesick blues
Just a blonde haired blue eyed picture of sin
Looking for someone to use

[Chorus]
She's a lover and fighter, she's a wild bull rider
And I’m wondering why she left me
Such a long time ago
She's a heartbreaker, she's a love taker
But she can break a heart
And take all the love she needs

[Verse 2]
Well I heard she got down in Beaumont
And she wound up in El Paso
She was tuff as a boot and thin as a rail
And she could step to the Cotton Eyed Joe
If you run across this flagrant fuzzy
Slip in and get her while you can
Cause before too long she'll be good as gone
And running with another man

[Chorus]
She's a lover and fighter, she's a wild bull rider
And I’m wondering why she left me
Such a long time ago
She's a heartbreaker, she's a love taker
But she can break a heart
And take all the love she needs

[Outro]
She's a heartbreaker, she's a love taker
But she can break a heart
And take all the love she needs
