[Verse 1]
Do you remember
Back in nineteen sixty six?
Country Jesus, Hillbilly blues
That's where I learned my licks
Oh, from coast to coast and line to line
In every county there
I'm talking about that outlaw X
It's cutting through the air

[Chorus]
Anywhere, ya'll
Everywhere, ya'll
I heard it, I heard it
I heard it on the X

[Verse 2]
We can all thank doctor B
Who stepped across the line
With lots of watts he took control
The first one of its kind
So listen to your radio
Most each and every night
Cause if you don't
It sure you won't get to feeling right

[Chorus]
Anywhere, ya'll
Everywhere, ya'll
I heard it, I heard it
I heard it on the X

[Instrumental outro 1:09-2:24]
