I was trashed, ridin' on my 74
Goin' out to even the score
She pulled the top down on her convertible
I've got a lot of miles to cover
But if you think you need a lover
All right

Climb on, hold tight, I got a long ride tonight

Look out, hold on
Don't stop to watch the wheels go 'round
Look out, hold on
I got to cover ground

Well, I flashed the colors that I wore
I got to have a little more
Of this sweet, sweet thing
I've got a lot of miles to cover
But if you think you need a lover
All right

Climb on, hold tight, I got a long ride tonight

Look out, hold on
Don't stop to watch the wheels go 'round
Look out, hold on
I got to cover ground...
