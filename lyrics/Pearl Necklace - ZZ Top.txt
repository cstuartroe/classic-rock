She's really upset with me again
I didn't give her what she likes
I don't know what to tell her
Don't know what to say
Everything got funky last night

She was really bombed
And I was really blown away
And when I asked her what she wanted
And this is what she had to say

A pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace

She gets a charge out of being so weird
Digs getting downright strange
But I can keep a handle on anything
Just this side of deranged

She was gettin' bombed
And I was gettin' blown away
And she knew it in her head
And this is what she had to say

A pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace

She is so tough
And pure as the driven slush
And that's not jewelry what she's talking 'bout
It really don't cost that much

She was gettin' bombed
And I was gettin' blown away
And she knew it in her head
And this is what she had to say

A pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
